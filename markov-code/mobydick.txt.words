WHO
WILL
SPEAK

NOT
TO

REVERENTIALLY
OF
A

IT
IS
OUT
OF
THE

DOTINGS
OF
THE

UPON
BROILED

HORSE
THAT
YOU
SEE
THE

OF
THOSE
CREATURES
IN
THEIR
HUGE
BAKEHOUSES
THE
PYRAMIDS
NO
WHEN
I
GO
TO
SEA
I
GO
AS
A
SIMPLE
SAILOR
RIGHT
BEFORE
THE
MAST
PLUMB
DOWN
INTO
THE
FORECASTLE
ALOFT
THERE
TO
THE
ROYAL
MASTHEAD
TRUE
THEY
RATHER
ORDER
ME
ABOUT
SOME
AND
MAKE
ME
JUMP
FROM
SPAR
TO
SPAR
LIKE
A
GRASSHOPPER
IN
A
MAY
MEADOW
AND
AT
FIRST
THIS
SORT
OF
THING
IS
UNPLEASANT
ENOUGH
IT
TOUCHES
ONES
SENSE
OF
HONOUR
PARTICULARLY
IF
YOU
COME
OF
AN
OLD
ESTABLISHED
FAMILY
IN
THE
LAND
THE
VAN
RENSSELAERS
OR
RANDOLPHS
OR
HARDICANUTES
AND
MORE
THAN
ALL
IF
JUST
PREVIOUS
TO
PUTTING
YOUR
HAND
INTO
THE
TARPOT
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
LORDING
IT
AS
A
COUNTRY
SCHOOLMASTER
MAKING
THE
TALLEST
BOYS
STAND
IN
AWE
OF
YOU
THE
TRANSITION
IS
A
KEEN
ONE
I
ASSURE
YOU
FROM
A
SCHOOLMASTER
TO
A
SAILOR
AND
REQUIRES
A
STRONG
DECOCTION
OF
SENECA
AND
THE
STOICS
TO
ENABLE
YOU
TO
GRIN
AND
BEAR
IT
BUT
EVEN
THIS
WEARS
OFF
IN
TIME
WHAT
OF
IT
IF
SOME
OLD
HUNKS
OF
A
SEACAPTAIN
ORDERS
ME
TO
GET
A
BROOM
AND
SWEEP
DOWN
THE
DECKS
WHAT
DOES
THAT
INDIGNITY
AMOUNT
TO
WEIGHED
I
MEAN
IN
THE
SCALES
OF
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
DO
YOU
THINK
THE
ARCHANGEL
GABRIEL
THINKS
ANYTHING
THE
LESS
OF
ME
BECAUSE
I
PROMPTLY
AND
RESPECTFULLY
OBEY
THAT
OLD
HUNKS
IN
THAT
PARTICULAR
INSTANCE
WHO
AINT
A
SLAVE
TELL
ME
THAT
WELL
THEN
HOWEVER
THE
OLD
SEACAPTAINS
MAY
ORDER
ME
ABOUTHOWEVER
THEY
MAY
THUMP
AND
PUNCH
ME
ABOUT
I
HAVE
THE
SATISFACTION
OF
KNOWING
THAT
IT
IS
ALL
RIGHT
THAT
EVERYBODY
ELSE
IS
ONE
WAY
OR
OTHER
SERVED
IN
MUCH
THE
SAME
WAYEITHER
IN
A
PHYSICAL
OR
METAPHYSICAL
POINT
OF
VIEW
THAT
IS
AND
SO
THE
UNIVERSAL
THUMP
IS
PASSED
ROUND
AND
ALL
HANDS
SHOULD
RUB
EACH
OTHERS
SHOULDERBLADES
AND
BE
CONTENT
AGAIN
I
ALWAYS
GO
TO
SEA
AS
A
SAILOR
BECAUSE
THEY
MAKE
A
POINT
OF
PAYING
ME
FOR
MY
TROUBLE
WHEREAS
THEY
NEVER
PAY
PASSENGERS
A
SINGLE
PENNY
THAT
I
EVER
HEARD
OF
ON
THE
CONTRARY
PASSENGERS
THEMSELVES
MUST
PAY
AND
THERE
IS
ALL
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN
THE
WORLD
BETWEEN
PAYING
AND
BEING
PAID
THE
ACT
OF
PAYING
IS
PERHAPS
THE
MOST
UNCOMFORTABLE
INFLICTION
THAT
THE
TWO
ORCHARD
THIEVES
ENTAILED
UPON
US
BUT
BEING
PAIDWHAT
WILL
COMPARE
WITH
IT
THE
URBANE
ACTIVITY
WITH
WHICH
A
MAN
RECEIVES
MONEY
IS
REALLY
MARVELLOUS
CONSIDERING
THAT
WE
SO
EARNESTLY
BELIEVE
MONEY
TO
BE
THE
ROOT
OF
ALL
EARTHLY
ILLS
AND
THAT
ON
NO
ACCOUNT
CAN
A
MONIED
MAN
ENTER
HEAVEN
AH
HOW
CHEERFULLY
WE
CONSIGN
OURSELVES
TO
PERDITION
FINALLY
I
ALWAYS
GO
TO
SEA
AS
A
SAILOR
BECAUSE
OF
THE
WHOLESOME
EXERCISE
AND
PURE
AIR
OF
THE
FORECASTLE
DECK
FOR
AS
IN
THIS
WORLD
HEAD
WINDS
ARE
FAR
MORE
PREVALENT
THAN
WINDS
FROM
ASTERN
THAT
IS
IF
YOU
NEVER
VIOLATE
THE
PYTHAGOREAN
MAXIM
SO
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
THE
COMMODORE
ON
THE
QUARTERDECK
GETS
HIS
ATMOSPHERE
AT
SECOND
HAND
FROM
THE
SAILORS
ON
THE
FORECASTLE
HE
THINKS
HE
BREATHES
IT
FIRST
BUT
NOT
SO
IN
MUCH
THE
SAME
WAY
DO
THE
COMMONALTY
LEAD
THEIR
LEADERS
IN
MANY
OTHER
THINGS
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
THAT
THE
LEADERS
LITTLE
SUSPECT
IT
BUT
WHEREFORE
IT
WAS
THAT
AFTER
HAVING
REPEATEDLY
SMELT
THE
SEA
AS
A
MERCHANT
SAILOR
I
SHOULD
NOW
TAKE
IT
INTO
MY
HEAD
TO
GO
ON
A
WHALING
VOYAGE
THIS
THE
INVISIBLE
POLICE
OFFICER
OF
THE
FATES
WHO
HAS
THE
CONSTANT
SURVEILLANCE
OF
ME
AND
SECRETLY
DOGS
ME
AND
INFLUENCES
ME
IN
SOME
UNACCOUNTABLE
WAYHE
CAN
BETTER
ANSWER
THAN
ANY
ONE
ELSE
AND
DOUBTLESS
MY
GOING
ON
THIS
WHALING
VOYAGE
FORMED
PART
OF
THE
GRAND
PROGRAMME
OF
PROVIDENCE
THAT
WAS
DRAWN
UP
A
LONG
TIME
AGO
IT
CAME
IN
AS
A
SORT
OF
BRIEF
INTERLUDE
AND
SOLO
BETWEEN
MORE
EXTENSIVE
PERFORMANCES
I
TAKE
IT
THAT
THIS
PART
OF
THE
BILL
MUST
HAVE
RUN
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
GRAND
CONTESTED
ELECTION
FOR
THE
PRESIDENCY
OF
THE
UNITED
STATES
WHALING
VOYAGE
BY
ONE
ISHMAEL
BLOODY
BATTLE
IN
AFFGHANISTAN
THOUGH
I
CANNOT
TELL
WHY
IT
WAS
EXACTLY
THAT
THOSE
STAGE
MANAGERS
THE
FATES
PUT
ME
DOWN
FOR
THIS
SHABBY
PART
OF
A
WHALING
VOYAGE
WHEN
OTHERS
WERE
SET
DOWN
FOR
MAGNIFICENT
PARTS
IN
HIGH
TRAGEDIES
AND
SHORT
AND
EASY
PARTS
IN
GENTEEL
COMEDIES
AND
JOLLY
PARTS
IN
FARCESTHOUGH
I
CANNOT
TELL
WHY
THIS
WAS
EXACTLY
YET
NOW
THAT
I
RECALL
ALL
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
I
THINK
I
CAN
SEE
A
LITTLE
INTO
THE
SPRINGS
AND
MOTIVES
WHICH
BEING
CUNNINGLY
PRESENTED
TO
ME
UNDER
VARIOUS
DISGUISES
INDUCED
ME
TO
SET
ABOUT
PERFORMING
THE
PART
I
DID
BESIDES
CAJOLING
ME
INTO
THE
DELUSION
THAT
IT
WAS
A
CHOICE
RESULTING
FROM
MY
OWN
UNBIASED
FREEWILL
AND
DISCRIMINATING
JUDGMENT
CHIEF
AMONG
THESE
MOTIVES
WAS
THE
OVERWHELMING
IDEA
OF
THE
GREAT
WHALE
HIMSELF
SUCH
A
PORTENTOUS
AND
MYSTERIOUS
MONSTER
ROUSED
ALL
MY
CURIOSITY
THEN
THE
WILD
AND
DISTANT
SEAS
WHERE
HE
ROLLED
HIS
ISLAND
BULK
THE
UNDELIVERABLE
NAMELESS
PERILS
OF
THE
WHALE
THESE
WITH
ALL
THE
ATTENDING
MARVELS
OF
A
THOUSAND
PATAGONIAN
SIGHTS
AND
SOUNDS
HELPED
TO
SWAY
ME
TO
MY
WISH
WITH
OTHER
MEN
PERHAPS
SUCH
THINGS
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
INDUCEMENTS
BUT
AS
FOR
ME
I
AM
TORMENTED
WITH
AN
EVERLASTING
ITCH
FOR
THINGS
REMOTE
I
LOVE
TO
SAIL
FORBIDDEN
SEAS
AND
LAND
ON
BARBAROUS
COASTS
NOT
IGNORING
WHAT
IS
GOOD
I
AM
QUICK
TO
PERCEIVE
A
HORROR
AND
COULD
STILL
BE
SOCIAL
WITH
ITWOULD
THEY
LET
MESINCE
IT
IS
BUT
WELL
TO
BE
ON
FRIENDLY
TERMS
WITH
ALL
THE
INMATES
OF
THE
PLACE
ONE
LODGES
IN
BY
REASON
OF
THESE

WAS

THE
CARPETBAG
I
STUFFED
A
SHIRT
OR

INTO
MY

TUCKED
IT
UNDER
MY

AND
STARTED
FOR
CAPE
HORN
AND
THE
PACIFIC
QUITTING
THE

CITY
OF

MANHATTO
I
DULY
ARRIVED
IN
NEW
BEDFORD
IT
WAS
A
SATURDAY
NIGHT
IN
DECEMBER
MUCH
WAS
I
DISAPPOINTED
UPON
LEARNING
THAT
THE
LITTLE
PACKET
FOR
NANTUCKET
HAD
ALREADY
SAILED
AND
THAT
NO
WAY
OF
REACHING
THAT
PLACE
WOULD
OFFER
TILL
THE
FOLLOWING
MONDAY
AS
MOST
YOUNG
CANDIDATES
FOR
THE
PAINS
AND
PENALTIES
OF
WHALING
STOP
AT
THIS
SAME
NEW
BEDFORD
THENCE
TO
EMBARK
ON
THEIR
VOYAGE
IT
MAY
AS
WELL
BE
RELATED
THAT
I
FOR
ONE
HAD
NO
IDEA
OF
SO
DOING
FOR
MY
MIND
WAS
MADE
UP
TO
SAIL
IN
NO
OTHER
THAN
A
NANTUCKET
CRAFT
BECAUSE
THERE
WAS
A
FINE
BOISTEROUS
SOMETHING
ABOUT
EVERYTHING
CONNECTED
WITH
THAT
FAMOUS
OLD
ISLAND
WHICH
AMAZINGLY
PLEASED
ME
BESIDES
THOUGH
NEW
BEDFORD
HAS
OF
LATE
BEEN
GRADUALLY
MONOPOLISING
THE
BUSINESS
OF
WHALING
AND
THOUGH
IN
THIS
MATTER
POOR

IS
NOW
MUCH
BEHIND

AND
STILL
ANOTHER

FOLLOWING
BEFORE

IN

ERE
I
COULD
EMBARK
FOR
MY
DESTINED
PORT
IT
BECAME
A
MATTER
OF
CONCERNMENT
WHERE
I
WAS
TO
EAT
AND
SLEEP
MEANWHILE
IT
WAS
A
VERY
DUBIOUSLOOKING
NAY
A
VERY
DARK
AND
DISMAL
NIGHT
BITINGLY
COLD
AND
CHEERLESS
I
KNEW
NO
ONE
IN
THE
PLACE
WITH
ANXIOUS
GRAPNELS
I
HAD
SOUNDED
MY
POCKET
AND
ONLY
BROUGHT
UP
A
FEW
PIECES
OF
SILVERSO
WHEREVER
YOU
GO
ISHMAEL
SAID
I
TO
MYSELF
AS
I
STOOD
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
A
DREARY
STREET
SHOULDERING
MY
BAG
AND
COMPARING
THE
GLOOM
TOWARDS
THE
NORTH
WITH
THE
DARKNESS
TOWARDS
THE
SOUTHWHEREVER
IN
YOUR
WISDOM
YOU
MAY
CONCLUDE
TO
LODGE
FOR
THE
NIGHT
MY
DEAR
ISHMAEL
BE
SURE
TO
INQUIRE
THE
PRICE
AND
DONT
BE
TOO
PARTICULAR
WITH
HALTING
STEPS
I
PACED
THE
STREETS
AND
PASSED
THE
SIGN
OF
THE
CROSSED
HARPOONSBUT
IT
LOOKED
TOO
EXPENSIVE
AND
JOLLY
THERE
FURTHER
ON
FROM
THE
BRIGHT
RED
WINDOWS
OF
THE
SWORDFISH
INN
THERE
CAME
SUCH
FERVENT
RAYS
THAT
IT
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
MELTED
THE
PACKED
SNOW
AND
ICE
FROM
BEFORE
THE
HOUSE
FOR
EVERYWHERE
ELSE
THE
CONGEALED
FROST
LAY
TEN
INCHES
THICK
IN
A
HARD
ASPHALTIC
PAVEMENTRATHER
WEARY
FOR
ME
WHEN
I
STRUCK
MY
FOOT
AGAINST
THE
FLINTY
PROJECTIONS
BECAUSE
FROM
HARD
REMORSELESS
SERVICE
THE
SOLES
OF
MY
BOOTS
WERE
IN
A
MOST
MISERABLE
PLIGHT
TOO
EXPENSIVE
AND
JOLLY
AGAIN
THOUGHT
I
PAUSING
ONE
MOMENT
TO
WATCH
THE
BROAD
GLARE
IN
THE
STREET
AND
HEAR
THE
SOUNDS
OF
THE
TINKLING
GLASSES
WITHIN
BUT
GO
ON
ISHMAEL
SAID
I
AT
LAST
DONT
YOU
HEAR
GET
AWAY
FROM
BEFORE
THE
DOOR
YOUR
PATCHED
BOOTS
ARE
STOPPING
THE
WAY
SO
ON
I
WENT
I
NOW
BY
INSTINCT
FOLLOWED
THE
STREETS
THAT
TOOK
ME
WATERWARD
FOR
THERE
DOUBTLESS
WERE
THE
CHEAPEST
IF
NOT
THE
CHEERIEST
INNS
SUCH
DREARY
STREETS
BLOCKS
OF
BLACKNESS
NOT
HOUSES
ON
EITHER
HAND
AND
HERE
AND
THERE
A
CANDLE
LIKE
A
CANDLE
MOVING
ABOUT
IN
A
TOMB
AT
THIS
HOUR
OF
THE
NIGHT
OF
THE
LAST
DAY
OF
THE
WEEK
THAT
QUARTER
OF
THE
TOWN
PROVED
ALL
BUT
DESERTED
BUT
PRESENTLY
I
CAME
TO
A
SMOKY
LIGHT
PROCEEDING
FROM
A
LOW
WIDE
BUILDING
THE
DOOR
OF
WHICH
STOOD
INVITINGLY
OPEN
IT
HAD
A
CARELESS
LOOK
AS
IF
IT
WERE
MEANT
FOR
THE
USES
OF
THE
PUBLIC
SO
ENTERING
THE
FIRST
THING
I
DID
WAS
TO
STUMBLE
OVER
AN
ASHBOX
IN
THE
PORCH
HA
THOUGHT
I
HA
AS
THE
FLYING
PARTICLES
ALMOST
CHOKED
ME
ARE
THESE
ASHES
FROM
THAT
DESTROYED
CITY
GOMORRAH
BUT
THE
CROSSED
HARPOONS
AND
THE
SWORDFISHTHIS
THEN
MUST
NEEDS
BE
THE
SIGN
OF
THE
TRAP
HOWEVER
I
PICKED
MYSELF
UP
AND
HEARING
A
LOUD
VOICE
WITHIN
PUSHED
ON
AND
OPENED
A
SECOND
INTERIOR
DOOR
IT
SEEMED
THE
GREAT
BLACK
PARLIAMENT
SITTING
IN
TOPHET
A
HUNDRED
BLACK
FACES
TURNED
ROUND
IN
THEIR

TO
PEER
AND
BEYOND
A
BLACK
ANGEL
OF
DOOM
WAS
BEATING
A
BOOK
IN
A
PULPIT
IT
WAS
A
NEGRO
CHURCH
AND
THE
PREACHERS
TEXT
WAS
ABOUT
THE
BLACKNESS
OF

AND
THE
WEEPING
AND
WAILING

THERE
HA

MUTTERED
I
BACKING

AT

NOT

AND
HEARD
A
FORLORN
CREAKING
IN

AND
LOOKING

SAW
A

OVER
THE

WITH
A

THEY

AND
I
SUPPOSE
THIS
PETER
HERE
IS
AN
EMIGRANT
FROM
THERE
AS
THE
LIGHT
LOOKED
SO
DIM
AND
THE
PLACE
FOR
THE
TIME
LOOKED
QUIET
ENOUGH
AND
THE
DILAPIDATED
LITTLE
WOODEN
HOUSE
ITSELF
LOOKED
AS
IF
IT
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
CARTED
HERE
FROM
THE
RUINS
OF
SOME
BURNT
DISTRICT
AND
AS
THE
SWINGING
SIGN
HAD
A
POVERTYSTRICKEN
SORT
OF

I

THAT
HERE
WAS
THE

FOR

CHAPTER

THE
SPOUTERINN
ENTERING
THAT
GABLEENDED
SPOUTERINN
YOU
FOUND
YOURSELF
IN
A
WIDE
LOW
STRAGGLING
ENTRY
WITH
OLDFASHIONED
WAINSCOTS
REMINDING
ONE
OF
THE
BULWARKS
OF
SOME
CONDEMNED
OLD
CRAFT
ON
ONE
SIDE
HUNG
A
VERY
LARGE
OILPAINTING
SO
THOROUGHLY
BESMOKED
AND
EVERY
WAY
DEFACED
THAT
IN
THE
UNEQUAL
CROSSLIGHTS
BY
WHICH
YOU
VIEWED
IT
IT
WAS
ONLY
BY
DILIGENT
STUDY
AND
A
SERIES
OF
SYSTEMATIC
VISITS
TO
IT
AND
CAREFUL
INQUIRY
OF
THE
NEIGHBORS
THAT
YOU
COULD
ANY
WAY
ARRIVE
AT
AN
UNDERSTANDING
OF
ITS
PURPOSE
SUCH
UNACCOUNTABLE
MASSES
OF
SHADES
AND
SHADOWS
THAT
AT
FIRST
YOU
ALMOST
THOUGHT
SOME
AMBITIOUS
YOUNG
ARTIST
IN
THE
TIME
OF
THE
NEW
ENGLAND
HAGS
HAD
ENDEAVORED
TO
DELINEATE
CHAOS
BEWITCHED
BUT
BY
DINT
OF
MUCH
AND
EARNEST
CONTEMPLATION
AND
OFT
REPEATED
PONDERINGS
AND
ESPECIALLY
BY
THROWING
OPEN
THE
LITTLE
WINDOW
TOWARDS
THE
BACK
OF
THE
ENTRY
YOU
AT
LAST
COME
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
SUCH
AN
IDEA
HOWEVER
WILD
MIGHT
NOT
BE
ALTOGETHER
UNWARRANTED
BUT
WHAT
MOST
PUZZLED
AND
CONFOUNDED
YOU
WAS
A
LONG
LIMBER
PORTENTOUS
BLACK
MASS
OF
SOMETHING
HOVERING
IN
THE
CENTRE
OF
THE
PICTURE
OVER
THREE
BLUE
DIM
PERPENDICULAR
LINES
FLOATING
IN
A
NAMELESS
YEAST
A
BOGGY
SOGGY
SQUITCHY
PICTURE
TRULY
ENOUGH
TO
DRIVE
A
NERVOUS
MAN
DISTRACTED
YET
WAS
THERE
A
SORT
OF
INDEFINITE
HALFATTAINED
UNIMAGINABLE
SUBLIMITY
ABOUT
IT
THAT
FAIRLY
FROZE
YOU
TO
IT
TILL
YOU
INVOLUNTARILY
TOOK
AN
OATH
WITH
YOURSELF
TO
FIND
OUT
WHAT
THAT
MARVELLOUS
PAINTING
MEANT
EVER
AND
ANON
A
BRIGHT
BUT
ALAS
DECEPTIVE
IDEA
WOULD
DART
YOU
THROUGHITS
THE
BLACK

AT

ALL
THESE

YIELDED
TO
THAT
ONE
PORTENTOUS
SOMETHING
IN
THE
PICTURES
MIDST
THAT
ONCE
FOUND
OUT
AND
ALL
THE
REST
WERE
PLAIN
BUT
STOP
DOES
IT
NOT
BEAR
A
FAINT
RESEMBLANCE
TO
A
GIGANTIC
FISH
EVEN
THE
GREAT
LEVIATHAN
HIMSELF
IN
FACT
THE
ARTISTS
DESIGN
SEEMED
THIS
A
FINAL
THEORY
OF
MY
OWN
PARTLY
BASED
UPON
THE
AGGREGATED
OPINIONS
OF
MANY

WITH
WHOM
I

PURPOSING
TO

OVER

IS
IN
THE
ENORMOUS
ACT
OF
IMPALING
HIMSELF
UPON
THE
THREE
MASTHEADS
THE
OPPOSITE
WALL
OF
THIS
ENTRY
WAS
HUNG
ALL
OVER
WITH
A
HEATHENISH
ARRAY
OF
MONSTROUS

SOME
WERE
THICKLY
SET
WITH
GLITTERING

OTHERS
WERE
TUFTED
WITH

IN

THEY
CALLED
HIM

A

WHO
FOR

DEARLY

THE
FULL
GLASSTHE
CAPE
HORN
MEASURE
WHICH
YOU
MAY
GULP
DOWN
FOR
A
SHILLING
UPON
ENTERING
THE
PLACE
I
FOUND
A
NUMBER
OF
YOUNG
SEAMEN
GATHERED
ABOUT
A
TABLE
EXAMINING
BY
A
DIM
LIGHT
DIVERS
SPECIMENS
OF
SKRIMSHANDER
I
SOUGHT
THE
LANDLORD
AND
TELLING
HIM
I
DESIRED
TO
BE
ACCOMMODATED
WITH
A
ROOM
RECEIVED
FOR
ANSWER
THAT
HIS
HOUSE
WAS
FULLNOT
A
BED
UNOCCUPIED
BUT
AVAST
HE
ADDED
TAPPING
HIS
FOREHEAD
YOU
HAINT
NO
OBJECTIONS
TO
SHARING
A
HARPOONEERS
BLANKET
HAVE
YE
I
SPOSE
YOU
ARE
GOIN
AWHALIN
SO
YOUD
BETTER
GET
USED
TO
THAT
SORT
OF
THING
I
TOLD
HIM
THAT
I
NEVER
LIKED
TO
SLEEP
TWO
IN
A
BED
THAT
IF
I
SHOULD
EVER
DO
SO
IT
WOULD
DEPEND
UPON
WHO
THE
HARPOONEER
MIGHT
BE
AND
THAT
IF
HE
THE
LANDLORD
REALLY
HAD
NO
OTHER
PLACE
FOR
ME
AND
THE
HARPOONEER
WAS
NOT
DECIDEDLY
OBJECTIONABLE
WHY
RATHER
THAN
WANDER
FURTHER
ABOUT
A
STRANGE
TOWN
ON
SO
BITTER
A
NIGHT
I
WOULD
PUT
UP
WITH
THE
HALF
OF
ANY
DECENT
MANS
BLANKET
I
THOUGHT
SO
ALL
RIGHT
TAKE
A
SEAT
SUPPERYOU
WANT
SUPPER
SUPPERLL
BE
READY
DIRECTLY
I
SAT
DOWN
ON
AN
OLD
WOODEN
SETTLE
CARVED
ALL
OVER
LIKE
A
BENCH
ON
THE
BATTERY
AT
ONE
END
A
RUMINATING
TAR
WAS
STILL
FURTHER
ADORNING
IT
WITH
HIS
JACKKNIFE
STOOPING
OVER
AND
DILIGENTLY
WORKING
AWAY
AT
THE
SPACE
BETWEEN
HIS
LEGS
HE
WAS
TRYING
HIS
HAND
AT
A
SHIP
UNDER
FULL
SAIL
BUT
HE
DIDNT
MAKE
MUCH
HEADWAY
I
THOUGHT
AT
LAST
SOME
FOUR
OR
FIVE
OF
US
WERE
SUMMONED
TO
OUR
MEAL
IN
AN
ADJOINING
ROOM
IT
WAS
COLD
AS
ICELANDNO
FIRE
AT
ALLTHE
LANDLORD
SAID
HE
COULDNT
AFFORD
IT
NOTHING
BUT
TWO
DISMAL
TALLOW
CANDLES
EACH
IN
A
WINDING
SHEET
WE
WERE
FAIN
TO
BUTTON
UP
OUR
MONKEY
JACKETS
AND
HOLD
TO
OUR
LIPS
CUPS
OF
SCALDING
TEA
WITH
OUR
HALF
FROZEN
FINGERS
BUT
THE
FARE
WAS
OF
THE
MOST
SUBSTANTIAL
KINDNOT
ONLY
MEAT
AND
POTATOES
BUT
DUMPLINGS
GOOD
HEAVENS
DUMPLINGS
FOR
SUPPER
ONE
YOUNG
FELLOW
IN
A
GREEN
BOX
COAT
ADDRESSED
HIMSELF
TO
THESE
DUMPLINGS
IN
A
MOST
DIREFUL
MANNER
MY
BOY
SAID
THE
LANDLORD
YOULL
HAVE
THE
NIGHTMARE
TO
A
DEAD
SARTAINTY
LANDLORD
I
WHISPERED
THAT
AINT
THE
HARPOONEER
IS
IT
OH
NO
SAID
HE
LOOKING
A
SORT
OF
DIABOLICALLY
FUNNY
THE
HARPOONEER
IS
A
DARK
COMPLEXIONED
CHAP
HE
NEVER
EATS
DUMPLINGS
HE
DONTHE
EATS
NOTHING
BUT
STEAKS
AND
HE
LIKES
EM
RARE
THE
DEVIL
HE
DOES
SAYS
I
WHERE
IS
THAT
HARPOONEER
IS
HE
HERE
HELL
BE
HERE
AFORE
LONG
WAS
THE
ANSWER
I
COULD
NOT
HELP
IT
BUT
I
BEGAN
TO
FEEL
SUSPICIOUS
OF
THIS
DARK
COMPLEXIONED
HARPOONEER
AT
ANY
RATE
I
MADE
UP
MY
MIND
THAT
IF
IT
SO
TURNED
OUT
THAT
WE
SHOULD
SLEEP
TOGETHER
HE
MUST
UNDRESS
AND
GET
INTO
BED
BEFORE
I
DID
SUPPER
OVER
THE
COMPANY
WENT
BACK
TO
THE
BARROOM
WHEN
KNOWING
NOT
WHAT
ELSE
TO
DO
WITH
MYSELF
I
RESOLVED
TO
SPEND
THE
REST
OF
THE
EVENING
AS
A
LOOKER
ON
PRESENTLY
A
RIOTING
NOISE
WAS
HEARD
WITHOUT
STARTING
UP
THE
LANDLORD
CRIED
THATS
THE
GRAMPUSS
CREW
I
SEED
HER
REPORTED
IN
THE
OFFING
THIS
MORNING
A
THREE
YEARS
VOYAGE
AND
A
FULL
SHIP
HURRAH
BOYS
NOW
WELL
HAVE
THE
LATEST
NEWS
FROM
THE
FEEGEES
A
TRAMPING
OF
SEA
BOOTS
WAS
HEARD
IN
THE
ENTRY
THE
DOOR
WAS
FLUNG
OPEN
AND
IN
ROLLED
A
WILD
SET
OF
MARINERS
ENOUGH
ENVELOPED
IN
THEIR
SHAGGY
WATCH
COATS
AND
WITH
THEIR
HEADS
MUFFLED
IN
WOOLLEN
COMFORTERS
ALL
BEDARNED
AND
RAGGED
AND
THEIR
BEARDS
STIFF
WITH
ICICLES
THEY
SEEMED
AN
ERUPTION
OF
BEARS
FROM
LABRADOR
THEY
HAD
JUST
LANDED
FROM
THEIR
BOAT
AND
THIS
WAS
THE
FIRST
HOUSE
THEY
ENTERED
NO
WONDER
THEN
THAT
THEY
MADE
A
STRAIGHT
WAKE
FOR
THE
WHALES
MOUTHTHE
BARWHEN
THE
WRINKLED
LITTLE
OLD
JONAH
THERE
OFFICIATING
SOON
POURED
THEM
OUT
BRIMMERS
ALL
ROUND
ONE
COMPLAINED
OF
A
BAD
COLD
IN
HIS
HEAD
UPON
WHICH
JONAH
MIXED
HIM
A
PITCHLIKE
POTION
OF
GIN
AND
MOLASSES
WHICH
HE
SWORE
WAS
A
SOVEREIGN
CURE
FOR
ALL
COLDS
AND
CATARRHS
WHATSOEVER
NEVER
MIND
OF
HOW
LONG
STANDING
OR
WHETHER
CAUGHT
OFF
THE
COAST
OF
LABRADOR
OR
ON
THE
WEATHER
SIDE
OF
AN
ICEISLAND
THE
LIQUOR
SOON
MOUNTED
INTO
THEIR
HEADS
AS
IT
GENERALLY
DOES
EVEN
WITH
THE
ARRANTEST
TOPERS
NEWLY
LANDED
FROM
SEA
AND
THEY
BEGAN
CAPERING
ABOUT
MOST
OBSTREPEROUSLY
I
OBSERVED
HOWEVER
THAT
ONE
OF
THEM
HELD
SOMEWHAT
ALOOF
AND
THOUGH
HE
SEEMED
DESIROUS
NOT
TO
SPOIL
THE
HILARITY
OF
HIS
SHIPMATES
BY
HIS
OWN
SOBER
FACE
YET
UPON
THE
WHOLE
HE
REFRAINED
FROM
MAKING
AS
MUCH
NOISE
AS
THE
REST
THIS
MAN
INTERESTED
ME
AT
ONCE
AND
SINCE
THE
SEAGODS
HAD
ORDAINED
THAT
HE
SHOULD
SOON
BECOME
MY
SHIPMATE
THOUGH
BUT
A
SLEEPINGPARTNER
ONE
SO
FAR
AS
THIS
NARRATIVE
IS
CONCERNED
I
WILL
HERE
VENTURE
UPON
A
LITTLE
DESCRIPTION
OF
HIM
HE
STOOD
FULL
SIX
FEET
IN
HEIGHT
WITH
NOBLE
SHOULDERS
AND
A
CHEST
LIKE
A
COFFERDAM
I
HAVE
SELDOM
SEEN
SUCH
BRAWN
IN
A
MAN
HIS
FACE
WAS
DEEPLY
BROWN
AND
BURNT
MAKING
HIS
WHITE
TEETH
DAZZLING
BY
THE
CONTRAST
WHILE
IN
THE
DEEP
SHADOWS
OF
HIS
EYES
FLOATED
SOME
REMINISCENCES
THAT
DID
NOT
SEEM
TO
GIVE
HIM
MUCH
JOY
HIS
VOICE
AT
ONCE
ANNOUNCED
THAT
HE
WAS
A
SOUTHERNER
AND
FROM
HIS
FINE
STATURE
I
THOUGHT
HE
MUST
BE
ONE
OF
THOSE
TALL
MOUNTAINEERS
FROM
THE
ALLEGHANIAN
RIDGE
IN
VIRGINIA
WHEN
THE
REVELRY
OF
HIS
COMPANIONS
HAD
MOUNTED
TO
ITS
HEIGHT
THIS
MAN
SLIPPED
AWAY
UNOBSERVED
AND
I
SAW
NO
MORE
OF
HIM
TILL
HE
BECAME
MY
COMRADE
ON
THE
SEA
IN
A
FEW
MINUTES
HOWEVER
HE
WAS
MISSED
BY
HIS
SHIPMATES
AND
BEING
IT
SEEMS
FOR
SOME
REASON
A
HUGE
FAVOURITE
WITH
THEM
THEY
RAISED
A
CRY
OF
BULKINGTON
BULKINGTON
WHERES
BULKINGTON
AND
DARTED
OUT
OF
THE
HOUSE
IN
PURSUIT
OF
HIM
IT
WAS
NOW
ABOUT
NINE
OCLOCK
AND
THE
ROOM
SEEMING
ALMOST
SUPERNATURALLY
QUIET
AFTER
THESE
ORGIES
I
BEGAN
TO
CONGRATULATE
MYSELF
UPON
A
LITTLE
PLAN
THAT
HAD
OCCURRED
TO
ME
JUST
PREVIOUS
TO
THE
ENTRANCE
OF
THE
SEAMEN
NO
MAN
PREFERS
TO
SLEEP
TWO
IN
A
BED
IN
FACT
YOU
WOULD
A
GOOD
DEAL
RATHER
NOT
SLEEP
WITH
YOUR
OWN
BROTHER
I
DONT
KNOW
HOW
IT
IS
BUT
PEOPLE
LIKE
TO
BE
PRIVATE
WHEN
THEY
ARE
SLEEPING
AND
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
SLEEPING
WITH
AN
UNKNOWN
STRANGER
IN
A
STRANGE
INN
IN
A
STRANGE
TOWN
AND
THAT
STRANGER
A
HARPOONEER
THEN
YOUR
OBJECTIONS
INDEFINITELY
MULTIPLY
NOR
WAS
THERE
ANY
EARTHLY
REASON
WHY
I
AS
A
SAILOR
SHOULD
SLEEP
TWO
IN
A
BED
MORE
THAN
ANYBODY
ELSE
FOR
SAILORS
NO
MORE
SLEEP
TWO
IN
A
BED
AT
SEA
THAN
BACHELOR
KINGS
DO
ASHORE
TO
BE
SURE
THEY
ALL
SLEEP
TOGETHER
IN
ONE
APARTMENT
BUT
YOU
HAVE
YOUR
OWN
HAMMOCK
AND
COVER
YOURSELF
WITH
YOUR
OWN
BLANKET
AND
SLEEP
IN
YOUR
OWN
SKIN
THE
MORE
I
PONDERED
OVER
THIS
HARPOONEER
THE
MORE
I
ABOMINATED
THE
THOUGHT
OF
SLEEPING
WITH
HIM
IT
WAS
FAIR
TO
PRESUME
THAT
BEING
A
HARPOONEER
HIS
LINEN
OR
WOOLLEN
AS
THE
CASE
MIGHT
BE
WOULD
NOT
BE
OF
THE
TIDIEST
CERTAINLY
NONE
OF
THE
FINEST
I
BEGAN
TO
TWITCH
ALL
OVER
BESIDES
IT
WAS
GETTING
LATE
AND
MY
DECENT
HARPOONEER
OUGHT
TO
BE
HOME
AND
GOING
BEDWARDS
SUPPOSE
NOW
HE
SHOULD
TUMBLE
IN
UPON
ME
AT
MIDNIGHTHOW
COULD
I
TELL
FROM
WHAT
VILE
HOLE
HE
HAD
BEEN
COMING
LANDLORD
IVE
CHANGED
MY
MIND
ABOUT
THAT
HARPOONEERI
SHANT
SLEEP
WITH
HIM
ILL
TRY
THE
BENCH
HERE
JUST
AS
YOU
PLEASE
IM
SORRY
I
CANT
SPARE
YE
A
TABLECLOTH
FOR
A
MATTRESS
AND
ITS
A
PLAGUY
ROUGH
BOARD
HEREFEELING
OF
THE
KNOTS
AND
NOTCHES
BUT
WAIT
A
BIT
SKRIMSHANDER
IVE
GOT
A
CARPENTERS
PLANE
THERE
IN
THE
BARWAIT
I
SAY
AND
ILL
MAKE
YE
SNUG
ENOUGH
SO
SAYING
HE
PROCURED
THE
PLANE
AND
WITH
HIS
OLD
SILK
HANDKERCHIEF
FIRST
DUSTING
THE
BENCH
VIGOROUSLY
SET
TO
PLANING
AWAY
AT
MY
BED
THE
WHILE
GRINNING
LIKE
AN
APE
THE
SHAVINGS
FLEW
RIGHT
AND
LEFT
TILL
AT
LAST
THE
PLANEIRON
CAME
BUMP
AGAINST
AN
INDESTRUCTIBLE
KNOT
THE
LANDLORD
WAS
NEAR
SPRAINING
HIS
WRIST
AND
I
TOLD
HIM
FOR
HEAVENS
SAKE
TO
QUITTHE
BED
WAS
SOFT
ENOUGH
TO
SUIT
ME
AND
I
DID
NOT
KNOW
HOW
ALL
THE
PLANING
IN
THE
WORLD
COULD
MAKE
EIDER
DOWN
OF
A
PINE
PLANK
SO
GATHERING
UP
THE
SHAVINGS
WITH
ANOTHER
GRIN
AND
THROWING
THEM
INTO
THE
GREAT
STOVE
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
ROOM
HE
WENT
ABOUT
HIS
BUSINESS
AND
LEFT
ME
IN
A
BROWN
STUDY
I
NOW
TOOK
THE
MEASURE
OF
THE
BENCH
AND
FOUND
THAT
IT
WAS
A
FOOT
TOO
SHORT
BUT
THAT
COULD
BE
MENDED
WITH
A
CHAIR
BUT
IT
WAS
A
FOOT
TOO
NARROW
AND
THE
OTHER
BENCH
IN
THE
ROOM
WAS
ABOUT
FOUR
INCHES
HIGHER
THAN
THE
PLANED
ONESO
THERE
WAS
NO
YOKING
THEM
I
THEN
PLACED
THE
FIRST
BENCH
LENGTHWISE
ALONG
THE
ONLY
CLEAR
SPACE
AGAINST
THE
WALL
LEAVING
A
LITTLE
INTERVAL
BETWEEN
FOR
MY
BACK
TO
SETTLE
DOWN
IN
BUT
I
SOON
FOUND
THAT
THERE
CAME
SUCH
A
DRAUGHT
OF
COLD
AIR
OVER
ME
FROM
UNDER
THE
SILL
OF
THE
WINDOW
THAT
THIS
PLAN
WOULD
NEVER

TOGETHER
FORMED
A
SERIES
OF
SMALL
WHIRLWINDS
IN

WHAT
THE
NEXT
MORNING
SO
SOON
AS
I
POPPED
OUT
OF

ROOM

HARPOONEER
MIGHT
BE
STANDING
IN

ENTRY

READY
TO
KNOCK
ME
DOWN

LOOKING
ROUND
ME
AGAIN
AND
SEEING
NO
POSSIBLE
CHANCE
OF

A
SUFFERABLE
NIGHT
UNLESS

AND
YOU

SAID
THE

ABOUT

STREETS
WHEN

HE
WANTED
TO
LAST

BUT
I
STOPPED
HIM
JUST
AS
HE
WAS
GOIN
OUT
OF
THE
DOOR
WITH
FOUR
HEADS
STRUNG
ON
A
STRING
FOR
ALL
THE
AIRTH
LIKE
A
STRING
OF
INIONS
THIS
ACCOUNT
CLEARED
UP
THE
OTHERWISE
UNACCOUNTABLE
MYSTERY
AND
SHOWED
THAT
THE
LANDLORD
AFTER
ALL
HAD
HAD
NO
IDEA
OF
FOOLING
MEBUT
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
WHAT
COULD
I
THINK
OF
A
HARPOONEER
WHO
STAYED
OUT
OF
A
SATURDAY
NIGHT
CLEAN
INTO
THE
HOLY
SABBATH
ENGAGED
IN
SUCH
A
CANNIBAL
BUSINESS
AS
SELLING
THE
HEADS
OF
DEAD
IDOLATORS
DEPEND
UPON
IT
LANDLORD
THAT
HARPOONEER
IS
A
DANGEROUS
MAN
HE
PAYS
REGLAR
WAS
THE
REJOINDER
BUT
COME
ITS
GETTING
DREADFUL
LATE
YOU
HAD
BETTER
BE
TURNING
FLUKESITS
A
NICE
BED
SAL
AND
ME
SLEPT
IN
THAT
ERE
BED
THE
NIGHT
WE
WERE
SPLICED
THERES
PLENTY
OF
ROOM
FOR
TWO
TO
KICK
ABOUT
IN
THAT
BED
ITS
AN
ALMIGHTY
BIG
BED
THAT
WHY
AFORE
WE
GIVE
IT
UP
SAL
USED
TO
PUT
OUR
SAM
AND
LITTLE
JOHNNY
IN
THE
FOOT
OF
IT
BUT
I
GOT
A
DREAMING
AND
SPRAWLING
ABOUT
ONE
NIGHT
AND
SOMEHOW
SAM
GOT
PITCHED
ON
THE
FLOOR
AND
CAME
NEAR
BREAKING
HIS
ARM
ARTER
THAT
SAL
SAID
IT
WOULDNT
DO
COME
ALONG
HERE
ILL
GIVE
YE
A
GLIM
IN
A
JIFFY
AND
SO
SAYING
HE
LIGHTED
A
CANDLE
AND
HELD
IT
TOWARDS
ME
OFFERING
TO
LEAD
THE
WAY
BUT
I
STOOD
IRRESOLUTE
WHEN
LOOKING
AT
A
CLOCK
IN
THE
CORNER
HE
EXCLAIMED
I
VUM
ITS
SUNDAYYOU
WONT
SEE
THAT
HARPOONEER
TONIGHT
HES
COME
TO
ANCHOR
SOMEWHERECOME
ALONG
THEN
DO
COME
WONT
YE
COME
I
CONSIDERED
THE
MATTER
A
MOMENT
AND
THEN
UP
STAIRS
WE
WENT
AND
I
WAS
USHERED
INTO
A
SMALL
ROOM
COLD
AS
A
CLAM
AND
FURNISHED
SURE
ENOUGH
WITH
A
PRODIGIOUS
BED
ALMOST
BIG
ENOUGH
INDEED
FOR
ANY
FOUR
HARPOONEERS
TO
SLEEP
ABREAST
THERE
SAID
THE
LANDLORD
PLACING
THE
CANDLE
ON
A
CRAZY
OLD
SEA
CHEST
THAT
DID
DOUBLE
DUTY
AS
A
WASHSTAND
AND
CENTRE
TABLE
THERE
MAKE
YOURSELF
COMFORTABLE
NOW
AND
GOOD
NIGHT
TO
YE
I
TURNED
ROUND
FROM
EYEING
THE
BED
BUT
HE
HAD
DISAPPEARED
FOLDING
BACK
THE
COUNTERPANE
I
STOOPED
OVER
THE
BED
THOUGH
NONE
OF
THE
MOST
ELEGANT
IT
YET
STOOD
THE
SCRUTINY
TOLERABLY
WELL
I
THEN
GLANCED
ROUND
THE
ROOM
AND
BESIDES
THE
BEDSTEAD
AND
CENTRE
TABLE
COULD
SEE
NO
OTHER
FURNITURE
BELONGING
TO
THE
PLACE
BUT
A
RUDE
SHELF
THE
FOUR
WALLS
AND
A
PAPERED
FIREBOARD
REPRESENTING
A
MAN
STRIKING
A
WHALE
OF
THINGS
NOT
PROPERLY
BELONGING
TO
THE
ROOM
THERE
WAS
A
HAMMOCK
LASHED
UP
AND
THROWN
UPON
THE
FLOOR
IN
ONE
CORNER
ALSO
A
LARGE
SEAMANS
BAG
CONTAINING
THE
HARPOONEERS
WARDROBE
NO
DOUBT
IN
LIEU
OF
A
LAND
TRUNK
LIKEWISE
THERE
WAS
A
PARCEL
OF
OUTLANDISH
BONE
FISH
HOOKS
ON
THE
SHELF
OVER
THE
FIREPLACE
AND
A
TALL
HARPOON
STANDING
AT
THE
HEAD
OF
THE
BED
BUT
WHAT
IS
THIS
ON
THE
CHEST
I
TOOK
IT
UP
AND
HELD
IT
CLOSE
TO
THE
LIGHT
AND
FELT
IT
AND
SMELT
IT
AND
TRIED
EVERY
WAY
POSSIBLE
TO
ARRIVE
AT
SOME
SATISFACTORY
CONCLUSION
CONCERNING
IT
I
CAN
COMPARE
IT
TO
NOTHING
BUT
A
LARGE
DOOR
MAT
ORNAMENTED
AT
THE
EDGES
WITH
LITTLE
TINKLING
TAGS
SOMETHING
LIKE
THE
STAINED
PORCUPINE
QUILLS
ROUND
AN
INDIAN
MOCCASIN
THERE
WAS
A
HOLE
OR
SLIT
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THIS
MAT
AS
YOU
SEE
THE
SAME
IN
SOUTH
AMERICAN
PONCHOS
BUT
COULD
IT
BE
POSSIBLE
THAT
ANY
SOBER
HARPOONEER
WOULD
GET
INTO
A
DOOR
MAT
AND
PARADE
THE
STREETS
OF
ANY
CHRISTIAN
TOWN
IN
THAT
SORT
OF
GUISE
I
PUT
IT
ON
TO
TRY
IT
AND
IT
WEIGHED
ME
DOWN
LIKE
A
HAMPER
BEING
UNCOMMONLY
SHAGGY
AND
THICK
AND
I
THOUGHT
A
LITTLE
DAMP
AS
THOUGH
THIS
MYSTERIOUS
HARPOONEER
HAD
BEEN
WEARING
IT
OF
A
RAINY
DAY
I
WENT
UP
IN
IT
TO
A
BIT
OF
GLASS
STUCK
AGAINST
THE
WALL
AND
I
NEVER
SAW
SUCH
A
SIGHT
IN
MY
LIFE
I
TORE
MYSELF
OUT
OF
IT
IN
SUCH
A
HURRY
THAT
I
GAVE
MYSELF
A
KINK
IN
THE
NECK
I
SAT
DOWN
ON
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
BED
AND
COMMENCED
THINKING
ABOUT
THIS
HEADPEDDLING
HARPOONEER
AND
HIS
DOOR
MAT
AFTER
THINKING
SOME
TIME
ON
THE
BEDSIDE
I
GOT
UP
AND
TOOK
OFF
MY
MONKEY
JACKET
AND
THEN
STOOD
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
ROOM
THINKING
I
THEN
TOOK
OFF
MY
COAT
AND
THOUGHT
A
LITTLE
MORE
IN
MY
SHIRT
SLEEVES
BUT
BEGINNING
TO
FEEL
VERY
COLD
NOW
HALF
UNDRESSED
AS
I
WAS
AND
REMEMBERING
WHAT
THE
LANDLORD
SAID
ABOUT
THE
HARPOONEERS
NOT
COMING
HOME
AT
ALL
THAT
NIGHT
IT
BEING
SO
VERY
LATE
I
MADE
NO
MORE
ADO
BUT
JUMPED
OUT
OF
MY
PANTALOONS
AND
BOOTS
AND
THEN
BLOWING
OUT
THE
LIGHT
TUMBLED
INTO
BED
AND
COMMENDED
MYSELF
TO
THE
CARE
OF
HEAVEN
WHETHER
THAT
MATTRESS
WAS
STUFFED
WITH
CORNCOBS
OR
BROKEN
CROCKERY
THERE
IS
NO
TELLING
BUT
I
ROLLED
ABOUT
A
GOOD
DEAL
AND
COULD
NOT
SLEEP
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
AT
LAST
I
SLID
OFF
INTO
A
LIGHT
DOZE
AND
HAD
PRETTY
NEARLY
MADE
A
GOOD
OFFING
TOWARDS
THE
LAND
OF
NOD
WHEN
I
HEARD
A
HEAVY
FOOTFALL
IN
THE
PASSAGE
AND
SAW
A
GLIMMER
OF
LIGHT
COME
INTO
THE
ROOM
FROM
UNDER
THE
DOOR
LORD
SAVE
ME
THINKS
I
THAT
MUST
BE
THE
HARPOONEER
THE
INFERNAL
HEADPEDDLER
BUT
I
LAY
PERFECTLY
STILL
AND
RESOLVED
NOT
TO
SAY
A
WORD
TILL
SPOKEN
TO
HOLDING
A
LIGHT
IN
ONE
HAND
AND
THAT
IDENTICAL
NEW
ZEALAND
HEAD
IN
THE
OTHER
THE
STRANGER
ENTERED
THE
ROOM
AND
WITHOUT
LOOKING
TOWARDS
THE
BED
PLACED
HIS
CANDLE
A
GOOD
WAY
OFF
FROM
ME
ON
THE
FLOOR
IN
ONE
CORNER
AND
THEN
BEGAN
WORKING
AWAY
AT
THE
KNOTTED
CORDS
OF
THE
LARGE
BAG
I
BEFORE
SPOKE
OF
AS
BEING
IN
THE
ROOM
I
WAS
ALL
EAGERNESS
TO
SEE
HIS
FACE
BUT
HE
KEPT
IT
AVERTED
FOR
SOME
TIME
WHILE
EMPLOYED
IN
UNLACING
THE
BAGS
MOUTH
THIS
ACCOMPLISHED
HOWEVER
HE
TURNED
ROUNDWHEN
GOOD
HEAVENS
WHAT
A
SIGHT
SUCH
A
FACE
IT
WAS
OF
A
DARK
PURPLISH
YELLOW
COLOUR
HERE
AND
THERE
STUCK
OVER
WITH
LARGE
BLACKISH
LOOKING
SQUARES
YES
ITS
JUST
AS
I
THOUGHT
HES
A
TERRIBLE
BEDFELLOW
HES
BEEN
IN
A
FIGHT
GOT
DREADFULLY
CUT
AND
HERE
HE
IS
JUST
FROM
THE
SURGEON
BUT
AT
THAT
MOMENT
HE
CHANCED
TO
TURN
HIS
FACE
SO
TOWARDS
THE
LIGHT
THAT
I
PLAINLY
SAW
THEY
COULD
NOT
BE
STICKINGPLASTERS
AT
ALL
THOSE
BLACK
SQUARES
ON
HIS
CHEEKS
THEY
WERE
STAINS
OF
SOME
SORT
OR
OTHER
AT
FIRST
I
KNEW
NOT
WHAT
TO
MAKE
OF
THIS
BUT
SOON
AN
INKLING
OF
THE
TRUTH
OCCURRED
TO
ME
I
REMEMBERED
A
STORY
OF
A
WHITE
MANA
WHALEMAN
TOOWHO
FALLING
AMONG
THE
CANNIBALS
HAD
BEEN
TATTOOED
BY
THEM
I
CONCLUDED
THAT
THIS
HARPOONEER
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
HIS
DISTANT
VOYAGES
MUST
HAVE
MET
WITH
A
SIMILAR
ADVENTURE
AND
WHAT
IS
IT
THOUGHT
I
AFTER
ALL
ITS
ONLY
HIS
OUTSIDE
A
MAN
CAN
BE
HONEST
IN
ANY
SORT
OF
SKIN
BUT
THEN
WHAT
TO
MAKE
OF
HIS
UNEARTHLY
COMPLEXION
THAT
PART
OF
IT
I
MEAN
LYING
ROUND
ABOUT
AND
COMPLETELY
INDEPENDENT
OF
THE
SQUARES
OF
TATTOOING
TO
BE
SURE
IT
MIGHT
BE
NOTHING
BUT
A
GOOD
COAT
OF
TROPICAL
TANNING
BUT
I
NEVER
HEARD
OF
A
HOT
SUNS
TANNING
A
WHITE
MAN
INTO
A
PURPLISH
YELLOW
ONE
HOWEVER
I
HAD
NEVER
BEEN
IN
THE
SOUTH
SEAS
AND
PERHAPS
THE
SUN
THERE
PRODUCED
THESE
EXTRAORDINARY
EFFECTS
UPON
THE
SKIN
NOW
WHILE
ALL
THESE
IDEAS
WERE
PASSING
THROUGH
ME
LIKE
LIGHTNING
THIS
HARPOONEER
NEVER
NOTICED
ME
AT
ALL
BUT
AFTER
SOME
DIFFICULTY
HAVING
OPENED
HIS
BAG
HE
COMMENCED
FUMBLING
IN
IT
AND
PRESENTLY
PULLED
OUT
A
SORT
OF
TOMAHAWK
AND
A
SEALSKIN
WALLET
WITH
THE
HAIR
ON
PLACING
THESE
ON
THE
OLD
CHEST
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
ROOM
HE
THEN
TOOK
THE
NEW
ZEALAND
HEADA
GHASTLY
THING
ENOUGHAND
CRAMMED
IT
DOWN
INTO
THE
BAG
HE
NOW
TOOK
OFF
HIS
HATA
NEW
BEAVER
HATWHEN
I
CAME
NIGH
SINGING
OUT
WITH
FRESH
SURPRISE
THERE
WAS
NO
HAIR
ON
HIS
HEADNONE
TO
SPEAK
OF
AT
LEASTNOTHING
BUT
A
SMALL
SCALPKNOT
TWISTED
UP
ON
HIS
FOREHEAD
HIS
BALD
PURPLISH
HEAD
NOW
LOOKED
FOR
ALL
THE
WORLD
LIKE
A
MILDEWED
SKULL
HAD
NOT
THE
STRANGER
STOOD
BETWEEN
ME
AND
THE
DOOR
I
WOULD
HAVE
BOLTED
OUT
OF
IT
QUICKER
THAN
EVER
I
BOLTED
A
DINNER
EVEN
AS
IT
WAS
I
THOUGHT
SOMETHING
OF
SLIPPING
OUT
OF
THE
WINDOW
BUT
IT
WAS
THE
SECOND
FLOOR
BACK
I
AM
NO
COWARD
BUT
WHAT
TO
MAKE
OF
THIS
HEADPEDDLING
PURPLE
RASCAL
ALTOGETHER
PASSED
MY
COMPREHENSION
IGNORANCE
IS
THE
PARENT
OF
FEAR
AND
BEING
COMPLETELY
NONPLUSSED
AND
CONFOUNDED
ABOUT
THE
STRANGER
I
CONFESS
I
WAS
NOW
AS
MUCH
AFRAID
OF
HIM
AS
IF
IT
WAS
THE
DEVIL
HIMSELF
WHO
HAD
THUS
BROKEN
INTO
MY
ROOM
AT
THE
DEAD
OF
NIGHT
IN
FACT
I
WAS
SO
AFRAID
OF
HIM
THAT
I
WAS
NOT
GAME
ENOUGH
JUST
THEN
TO
ADDRESS
HIM
AND
DEMAND
A
SATISFACTORY
ANSWER
CONCERNING
WHAT
SEEMED
INEXPLICABLE
IN
HIM
MEANWHILE
HE
CONTINUED
THE
BUSINESS
OF
UNDRESSING
AND
AT
LAST
SHOWED
HIS
CHEST
AND
ARMS
AS
I
LIVE
THESE
COVERED
PARTS
OF
HIM
WERE
CHECKERED
WITH
THE
SAME
SQUARES
AS
HIS
FACE
HIS
BACK
TOO
WAS
ALL
OVER
THE
SAME
DARK
SQUARES
HE
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
BEEN
IN
A
THIRTY
YEARS
WAR
AND
JUST
ESCAPED
FROM
IT
WITH
A
STICKINGPLASTER
SHIRT
STILL
MORE
HIS
VERY
LEGS
WERE
MARKED
AS
IF
A
PARCEL
OF
DARK
GREEN
FROGS
WERE
RUNNING
UP
THE
TRUNKS
OF
YOUNG
PALMS
IT
WAS
NOW
QUITE
PLAIN
THAT
HE
MUST
BE
SOME
ABOMINABLE
SAVAGE
OR
OTHER
SHIPPED
ABOARD
OF
A
WHALEMAN
IN
THE
SOUTH
SEAS
AND
SO
LANDED
IN
THIS
CHRISTIAN
COUNTRY
I
QUAKED
TO
THINK
OF
IT
A
PEDDLER
OF
HEADS
TOOPERHAPS
THE
HEADS
OF
HIS
OWN
BROTHERS
HE
MIGHT
TAKE
A
FANCY
TO
MINEHEAVENS
LOOK
AT
THAT
TOMAHAWK
BUT
THERE
WAS
NO
TIME
FOR
SHUDDERING
FOR
NOW
THE
SAVAGE
WENT
ABOUT
SOMETHING
THAT
COMPLETELY
FASCINATED
MY
ATTENTION
AND
CONVINCED
ME
THAT
HE
MUST
INDEED
BE
A
HEATHEN
GOING
TO
HIS
HEAVY
GREGO
OR
WRAPALL
OR
DREADNAUGHT
WHICH
HE
HAD
PREVIOUSLY
HUNG
ON
A
CHAIR
HE
FUMBLED
IN
THE
POCKETS
AND
PRODUCED
AT
LENGTH
A
CURIOUS
LITTLE
DEFORMED
IMAGE
WITH
A
HUNCH
ON
ITS
BACK
AND
EXACTLY
THE
COLOUR
OF
A
THREE
DAYS
OLD
CONGO
BABY
REMEMBERING
THE
EMBALMED
HEAD
AT
FIRST
I
ALMOST
THOUGHT
THAT
THIS
BLACK
MANIKIN
WAS
A
REAL
BABY
PRESERVED
IN
SOME
SIMILAR
MANNER
BUT
SEEING
THAT
IT
WAS
NOT
AT
ALL
LIMBER
AND
THAT
IT
GLISTENED
A
GOOD
DEAL
LIKE
POLISHED
EBONY
I
CONCLUDED
THAT
IT
MUST
BE
NOTHING
BUT
A
WOODEN
IDOL
WHICH
INDEED
IT
PROVED
TO
BE
FOR
NOW
THE
SAVAGE
GOES
UP
TO
THE
EMPTY
FIREPLACE
AND
REMOVING
THE
PAPERED
FIREBOARD
SETS
UP
THIS
LITTLE
HUNCHBACKED
IMAGE
LIKE
A
TENPIN
BETWEEN
THE
ANDIRONS
THE
CHIMNEY
JAMBS
AND
ALL
THE
BRICKS
INSIDE
WERE
VERY
SOOTY
SO
THAT
I
THOUGHT
THIS
FIREPLACE
MADE
A
VERY
APPROPRIATE
LITTLE
SHRINE
OR
CHAPEL
FOR
HIS
CONGO
IDOL
I
NOW
SCREWED
MY
EYES
HARD
TOWARDS
THE
HALF
HIDDEN
IMAGE
FEELING
BUT
ILL
AT
EASE
MEANTIMETO
SEE
WHAT
WAS
NEXT
TO
FOLLOW
FIRST
HE
TAKES
ABOUT
A
DOUBLE
HANDFUL
OF
SHAVINGS
OUT
OF
HIS
GREGO
POCKET
AND
PLACES
THEM
CAREFULLY
BEFORE
THE
IDOL
THEN
LAYING
A
BIT
OF
SHIP
BISCUIT
ON
TOP
AND
APPLYING
THE
FLAME
FROM
THE
LAMP
HE
KINDLED
THE
SHAVINGS
INTO
A
SACRIFICIAL
BLAZE
PRESENTLY
AFTER
MANY
HASTY
SNATCHES
INTO
THE
FIRE
AND
STILL
HASTIER
WITHDRAWALS
OF
HIS
FINGERS
WHEREBY
HE
SEEMED
TO
BE
SCORCHING
THEM
BADLY
HE
AT
LAST
SUCCEEDED
IN
DRAWING
OUT
THE
BISCUIT
THEN
BLOWING
OFF
THE
HEAT
AND
ASHES
A
LITTLE
HE
MADE
A
POLITE
OFFER
OF
IT
TO
THE
LITTLE
NEGRO
BUT
THE
LITTLE
DEVIL
DID
NOT
SEEM
TO
FANCY
SUCH
DRY
SORT
OF
FARE
AT
ALL
HE
NEVER
MOVED
HIS
LIPS
ALL
THESE
STRANGE
ANTICS
WERE
ACCOMPANIED
BY
STILL
STRANGER
GUTTURAL
NOISES
FROM
THE
DEVOTEE
WHO
SEEMED
TO
BE
PRAYING
IN
A
SINGSONG
OR
ELSE
SINGING
SOME
PAGAN
PSALMODY
OR
OTHER
DURING
WHICH
HIS
FACE
TWITCHED
ABOUT
IN
THE
MOST
UNNATURAL
MANNER
AT
LAST
EXTINGUISHING
THE
FIRE
HE
TOOK
THE
IDOL
UP
VERY
UNCEREMONIOUSLY
AND
BAGGED
IT
AGAIN
IN
HIS
GREGO
POCKET
AS
CARELESSLY
AS
IF
HE
WERE
A
SPORTSMAN
BAGGING
A
DEAD
WOODCOCK
ALL
THESE
QUEER
PROCEEDINGS
INCREASED
MY
UNCOMFORTABLENESS
AND
SEEING
HIM
NOW
EXHIBITING
STRONG
SYMPTOMS
OF
CONCLUDING
HIS
BUSINESS
OPERATIONS
AND
JUMPING
INTO
BED
WITH
ME
I
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
HIGH
TIME
NOW
OR
NEVER
BEFORE
THE
LIGHT
WAS
PUT
OUT
TO
BREAK
THE
SPELL
IN
WHICH
I
HAD
SO
LONG
BEEN
BOUND
BUT
THE
INTERVAL
I
SPENT
IN
DELIBERATING
WHAT
TO
SAY
WAS
A
FATAL
ONE
TAKING
UP
HIS
TOMAHAWK
FROM
THE
TABLE
HE
EXAMINED
THE
HEAD
OF
IT
FOR
AN
INSTANT
AND
THEN
HOLDING
IT
TO
THE
LIGHT
WITH
HIS
MOUTH
AT
THE
HANDLE
HE
PUFFED
OUT
GREAT
CLOUDS
OF
TOBACCO
SMOKE
THE
NEXT
MOMENT
THE
LIGHT
WAS
EXTINGUISHED
AND
THIS
WILD
CANNIBAL
TOMAHAWK
BETWEEN
HIS
TEETH
SPRANG
INTO
BED
WITH
ME
I
SANG
OUT
I
COULD
NOT
HELP
IT
NOW
AND
GIVING
A
SUDDEN
GRUNT
OF
ASTONISHMENT
HE
BEGAN
FEELING
ME
STAMMERING
OUT
SOMETHING
I
KNEW
NOT
WHAT
I
ROLLED
AWAY
FROM
HIM
AGAINST
THE
WALL
AND
THEN
CONJURED
HIM
WHOEVER
OR
WHATEVER
HE
MIGHT
BE
TO
KEEP
QUIET
AND
LET
ME
GET
UP
AND
LIGHT
THE
LAMP
AGAIN
BUT
HIS
GUTTURAL
RESPONSES
SATISFIED
ME
AT
ONCE
THAT
HE

COMPREHENDED

THE
HOT
TOBACCO

ABOUT
ME
TILL
I
THOUGHT
MY
LINEN
WOULD
GET
ON
FIRE
BUT
THANK
HEAVEN
AT
THAT
MOMENT
THE
LANDLORD
CAME
INTO
THE
ROOM

FROM
THE

I
RAN

CHAPTER
4
THE
COUNTERPANE
UPON
WAKING
NEXT
MORNING
ABOUT
DAYLIGHT
I
FOUND
QUEEQUEGS
ARM
THROWN
OVER
ME
IN
THE
MOST
LOVING
AND
AFFECTIONATE
MANNER
YOU
HAD
ALMOST
THOUGHT
I
HAD
BEEN
HIS
WIFE
THE
COUNTERPANE
WAS
OF
PATCHWORK
FULL
OF
ODD
LITTLE
PARTICOLOURED
SQUARES
AND
TRIANGLES
AND
THIS
ARM
OF
HIS
TATTOOED
ALL
OVER
WITH
AN
INTERMINABLE
CRETAN
LABYRINTH
OF
A
FIGURE
NO
TWO
PARTS
OF
WHICH
WERE
OF
ONE
PRECISE
SHADEOWING
I
SUPPOSE
TO
HIS
KEEPING
HIS
ARM
AT
SEA
UNMETHODICALLY
IN
SUN
AND
SHADE
HIS
SHIRT
SLEEVES
IRREGULARLY
ROLLED
UP
AT
VARIOUS
TIMESTHIS
SAME
ARM
OF
HIS
I
SAY
LOOKED
FOR
ALL
THE
WORLD
LIKE
A
STRIP
OF
THAT
SAME
PATCHWORK
QUILT
INDEED
PARTLY
LYING
ON
IT
AS
THE
ARM
DID
WHEN
I
FIRST
AWOKE
I
COULD
HARDLY
TELL
IT
FROM
THE
QUILT
THEY
SO
BLENDED
THEIR
HUES
TOGETHER
AND
IT
WAS
ONLY
BY
THE
SENSE
OF
WEIGHT
AND
PRESSURE
THAT
I
COULD
TELL
THAT
QUEEQUEG
WAS
HUGGING
ME
MY
SENSATIONS
WERE
STRANGE
LET
ME
TRY
TO
EXPLAIN
THEM
WHEN
I
WAS
A
CHILD
I
WELL
REMEMBER
A
SOMEWHAT
SIMILAR
CIRCUMSTANCE
THAT
BEFELL
ME
WHETHER
IT
WAS
A
REALITY
OR
A
DREAM
I
NEVER
COULD
ENTIRELY
SETTLE
THE
CIRCUMSTANCE
WAS
THIS
I
HAD
BEEN
CUTTING
UP
SOME
CAPER
OR
OTHERI
THINK
IT
WAS
TRYING
TO
CRAWL
UP
THE
CHIMNEY
AS
I
HAD
SEEN
A
LITTLE
SWEEP
DO
A
FEW
DAYS
PREVIOUS
AND
MY
STEPMOTHER
WHO
SOMEHOW
OR
OTHER
WAS
ALL
THE
TIME
WHIPPING
ME
OR
SENDING
ME
TO
BED
SUPPERLESSMY
MOTHER
DRAGGED
ME
BY
THE
LEGS
OUT
OF
THE
CHIMNEY
AND
PACKED
ME
OFF
TO
BED
THOUGH
IT
WAS
ONLY
TWO
OCLOCK
IN
THE
AFTERNOON
OF
THE
21ST
JUNE
THE
LONGEST
DAY
IN
THE
YEAR
IN
OUR
HEMISPHERE
I
FELT
DREADFULLY
BUT
THERE
WAS
NO
HELP
FOR
IT
SO
UP
STAIRS
I
WENT
TO
MY
LITTLE
ROOM
IN
THE
THIRD
FLOOR
UNDRESSED
MYSELF
AS
SLOWLY
AS
POSSIBLE
SO
AS
TO
KILL
TIME
AND
WITH
A
BITTER
SIGH
GOT
BETWEEN
THE
SHEETS
I
LAY
THERE
DISMALLY
CALCULATING
THAT
SIXTEEN
ENTIRE
HOURS
MUST
ELAPSE
BEFORE
I
COULD
HOPE
FOR
A
RESURRECTION
SIXTEEN
HOURS
IN
BED
THE
SMALL
OF
MY
BACK
ACHED
TO
THINK
OF
IT
AND
IT
WAS
SO
LIGHT
TOO
THE
SUN
SHINING
IN
AT
THE
WINDOW
AND
A
GREAT
RATTLING
OF
COACHES
IN
THE
STREETS
AND
THE
SOUND
OF
GAY
VOICES
ALL
OVER
THE
HOUSE
I
FELT
WORSE
AND
WORSEAT
LAST
I
GOT
UP
DRESSED
AND
SOFTLY
GOING
DOWN
IN
MY
STOCKINGED
FEET
SOUGHT
OUT
MY
STEPMOTHER
AND
SUDDENLY
THREW
MYSELF
AT
HER
FEET
BESEECHING
HER
AS
A
PARTICULAR
FAVOUR
TO
GIVE
ME
A
GOOD
SLIPPERING
FOR
MY
MISBEHAVIOUR
ANYTHING
INDEED
BUT
CONDEMNING
ME
TO
LIE
ABED
SUCH
AN
UNENDURABLE
LENGTH
OF
TIME
BUT
SHE
WAS
THE
BEST
AND
MOST
CONSCIENTIOUS
OF
STEPMOTHERS
AND
BACK
I
HAD
TO
GO
TO
MY
ROOM
FOR
SEVERAL
HOURS
I
LAY
THERE
BROAD
AWAKE
FEELING
A
GREAT
DEAL
WORSE
THAN
I
HAVE
EVER
DONE
SINCE
EVEN
FROM
THE
GREATEST
SUBSEQUENT
MISFORTUNES
AT
LAST
I
MUST
HAVE
FALLEN
INTO
A
TROUBLED
NIGHTMARE
OF
A
DOZE
AND
SLOWLY
WAKING
FROM
ITHALF
STEEPED
IN
DREAMSI
OPENED
MY
EYES
AND
THE
BEFORE
SUNLIT
ROOM
WAS
NOW
WRAPPED
IN
OUTER
DARKNESS
INSTANTLY
I
FELT
A
SHOCK
RUNNING
THROUGH
ALL
MY
FRAME
NOTHING
WAS
TO
BE
SEEN
AND
NOTHING
WAS
TO
BE
HEARD
BUT
A
SUPERNATURAL
HAND
SEEMED
PLACED
IN
MINE
MY
ARM
HUNG
OVER
THE
COUNTERPANE
AND
THE
NAMELESS
UNIMAGINABLE
SILENT
FORM
OR
PHANTOM
TO
WHICH
THE
HAND
BELONGED
SEEMED
CLOSELY
SEATED
BY
MY
BEDSIDE
FOR
WHAT
SEEMED
AGES
PILED
ON
AGES
I
LAY
THERE
FROZEN
WITH
THE
MOST
AWFUL
FEARS
NOT
DARING
TO
DRAG
AWAY
MY
HAND
YET
EVER
THINKING
THAT
IF
I
COULD
BUT
STIR
IT
ONE
SINGLE
INCH
THE
HORRID
SPELL
WOULD
BE
BROKEN
I
KNEW
NOT
HOW
THIS
CONSCIOUSNESS
AT
LAST
GLIDED
AWAY
FROM
ME
BUT
WAKING
IN
THE
MORNING
I
SHUDDERINGLY
REMEMBERED
IT
ALL
AND
FOR
DAYS
AND
WEEKS
AND
MONTHS
AFTERWARDS
I
LOST
MYSELF
IN
CONFOUNDING
ATTEMPTS
TO
EXPLAIN
THE
MYSTERY
NAY
TO
THIS
VERY
HOUR
I
OFTEN
PUZZLE
MYSELF
WITH
IT
NOW
TAKE
AWAY
THE
AWFUL
FEAR
AND
MY
SENSATIONS
AT
FEELING
THE
SUPERNATURAL
HAND
IN
MINE
WERE
VERY
SIMILAR
IN
THEIR
STRANGENESS
TO
THOSE
WHICH
I
EXPERIENCED
ON
WAKING
UP
AND
SEEING
QUEEQUEGS
PAGAN
ARM
THROWN
ROUND
ME
BUT
AT
LENGTH
ALL
THE
PAST
NIGHTS
EVENTS
SOBERLY
RECURRED
ONE
BY
ONE
IN
FIXED
REALITY
AND
THEN
I
LAY
ONLY
ALIVE
TO
THE
COMICAL
PREDICAMENT
FOR
THOUGH
I
TRIED
TO
MOVE
HIS
ARMUNLOCK
HIS
BRIDEGROOM
CLASPYET
SLEEPING
AS
HE
WAS
HE
STILL
HUGGED
ME
TIGHTLY
AS
THOUGH
NAUGHT
BUT
DEATH
SHOULD
PART
US
TWAIN
I
NOW
STROVE
TO
ROUSE
HIMQUEEQUEGBUT
HIS
ONLY
ANSWER
WAS
A
SNORE
I
THEN
ROLLED
OVER
MY
NECK
FEELING
AS
IF
IT
WERE
IN
A
HORSECOLLAR
AND
SUDDENLY
FELT
A
SLIGHT
SCRATCH
THROWING
ASIDE
THE
COUNTERPANE
THERE
LAY
THE
TOMAHAWK
SLEEPING
BY
THE
SAVAGES
SIDE
AS
IF
IT
WERE
A
HATCHETFACED
BABY
A
PRETTY
PICKLE
TRULY
THOUGHT
I
ABED
HERE
IN
A
STRANGE
HOUSE
IN
THE
BROAD
DAY
WITH
A
CANNIBAL
AND
A
TOMAHAWK
QUEEQUEGIN
THE
NAME
OF
GOODNESS
QUEEQUEG
WAKE
AT
LENGTH
BY
DINT
OF
MUCH
WRIGGLING
AND
LOUD
AND
INCESSANT
EXPOSTULATIONS
UPON
THE
UNBECOMINGNESS
OF
HIS
HUGGING
A
FELLOW
MALE
IN
THAT
MATRIMONIAL
SORT
OF
STYLE
I
SUCCEEDED
IN
EXTRACTING
A
GRUNT
AND
PRESENTLY
HE
DREW
BACK
HIS
ARM
SHOOK
HIMSELF
ALL
OVER
LIKE
A
NEWFOUNDLAND
DOG
JUST
FROM
THE
WATER
AND
SAT
UP
IN
BED
STIFF
AS
A
PIKESTAFF
LOOKING
AT
ME
AND
RUBBING
HIS
EYES
AS
IF
HE
DID
NOT
ALTOGETHER
REMEMBER
HOW
I
CAME
TO
BE
THERE
THOUGH
A
DIM
CONSCIOUSNESS
OF
KNOWING
SOMETHING
ABOUT
ME
SEEMED
SLOWLY
DAWNING
OVER
HIM
MEANWHILE
I
LAY
QUIETLY
EYEING
HIM
HAVING
NO
SERIOUS
MISGIVINGS
NOW
AND
BENT
UPON
NARROWLY
OBSERVING
SO
CURIOUS
A
CREATURE
WHEN
AT
LAST
HIS
MIND
SEEMED
MADE
UP
TOUCHING
THE
CHARACTER
OF
HIS
BEDFELLOW
AND
HE
BECAME
AS
IT
WERE
RECONCILED
TO
THE
FACT
HE
JUMPED
OUT
UPON
THE
FLOOR
AND
BY
CERTAIN
SIGNS
AND
SOUNDS
GAVE
ME
TO
UNDERSTAND
THAT
IF
IT
PLEASED
ME
HE
WOULD
DRESS
FIRST
AND
THEN
LEAVE
ME
TO
DRESS
AFTERWARDS
LEAVING
THE
WHOLE
APARTMENT
TO
MYSELF
THINKS
I
QUEEQUEG
UNDER
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
THIS
IS
A
VERY
CIVILIZED
OVERTURE
BUT
THE
TRUTH
IS
THESE
SAVAGES
HAVE
AN
INNATE
SENSE
OF
DELICACY
SAY
WHAT
YOU
WILL
IT
IS
MARVELLOUS
HOW
ESSENTIALLY
POLITE
THEY
ARE
I
PAY
THIS
PARTICULAR
COMPLIMENT
TO
QUEEQUEG
BECAUSE
HE
TREATED
ME
WITH
SO
MUCH
CIVILITY
AND
CONSIDERATION
WHILE
I
WAS
GUILTY
OF
GREAT
RUDENESS
STARING
AT
HIM
FROM
THE
BED
AND
WATCHING
ALL
HIS
TOILETTE
MOTIONS
FOR
THE
TIME
MY
CURIOSITY
GETTING
THE
BETTER
OF
MY
BREEDING
NEVERTHELESS
A
MAN
LIKE
QUEEQUEG
YOU
DONT
SEE
EVERY
DAY
HE
AND
HIS
WAYS
WERE
WELL
WORTH
UNUSUAL
REGARDING
HE
COMMENCED
DRESSING
AT
TOP
BY
DONNING
HIS
BEAVER
HAT
A
VERY
TALL
ONE
BY
THE
BY
AND
THENSTILL
MINUS
HIS
TROWSERSHE
HUNTED
UP
HIS
BOOTS
WHAT
UNDER
THE
HEAVENS
HE
DID
IT
FOR
I
CANNOT
TELL
BUT
HIS
NEXT
MOVEMENT
WAS
TO
CRUSH
HIMSELFBOOTS
IN
HAND
AND
HAT
ONUNDER
THE
BED
WHEN
FROM
SUNDRY
VIOLENT
GASPINGS
AND
STRAININGS
I
INFERRED
HE
WAS
HARD
AT
WORK
BOOTING
HIMSELF
THOUGH
BY
NO
LAW
OF
PROPRIETY
THAT
I
EVER
HEARD
OF
IS
ANY
MAN
REQUIRED
TO
BE
PRIVATE
WHEN
PUTTING
ON
HIS
BOOTS
BUT
QUEEQUEG
DO
YOU
SEE
WAS
A
CREATURE
IN
THE
TRANSITION
STAGENEITHER
CATERPILLAR
NOR
BUTTERFLY
HE
WAS
JUST
ENOUGH
CIVILIZED
TO
SHOW
OFF
HIS
OUTLANDISHNESS
IN
THE
STRANGEST
POSSIBLE
MANNERS
HIS
EDUCATION
WAS
NOT
YET
COMPLETED
HE
WAS
AN
UNDERGRADUATE
IF
HE
HAD
NOT
BEEN
A
SMALL
DEGREE
CIVILIZED
HE
VERY
PROBABLY
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
TROUBLED
HIMSELF
WITH
BOOTS
AT
ALL
BUT
THEN
IF
HE
HAD
NOT
BEEN
STILL
A
SAVAGE
HE
NEVER
WOULD
HAVE
DREAMT
OF
GETTING
UNDER
THE
BED
TO
PUT
THEM
ON
AT
LAST
HE
EMERGED
WITH
HIS
HAT
VERY
MUCH
DENTED
AND
CRUSHED
DOWN
OVER
HIS
EYES
AND
BEGAN
CREAKING
AND
LIMPING
ABOUT
THE
ROOM
AS
IF
NOT
BEING
MUCH
ACCUSTOMED
TO
BOOTS
HIS
PAIR
OF
DAMP
WRINKLED
COWHIDE
ONESPROBABLY
NOT
MADE
TO
ORDER
EITHERRATHER
PINCHED
AND
TORMENTED
HIM
AT
THE
FIRST
GO
OFF
OF
A
BITTER
COLD
MORNING
SEEING
NOW
THAT
THERE
WERE
NO
CURTAINS
TO
THE
WINDOW
AND
THAT
THE
STREET
BEING
VERY
NARROW
THE
HOUSE
OPPOSITE
COMMANDED
A
PLAIN
VIEW
INTO
THE
ROOM
AND
OBSERVING
MORE
AND
MORE
THE
INDECOROUS
FIGURE
THAT
QUEEQUEG
MADE
STAVING
ABOUT
WITH
LITTLE
ELSE
BUT
HIS
HAT
AND
BOOTS
ON
I
BEGGED
HIM
AS
WELL
AS
I
COULD
TO
ACCELERATE
HIS
TOILET
SOMEWHAT
AND
PARTICULARLY
TO
GET
INTO
HIS
PANTALOONS
AS
SOON
AS
POSSIBLE
HE
COMPLIED
AND
THEN
PROCEEDED
TO
WASH
HIMSELF
AT
THAT
TIME
IN
THE
MORNING
ANY
CHRISTIAN
WOULD
HAVE
WASHED
HIS
FACE
BUT
QUEEQUEG
TO
MY
AMAZEMENT
CONTENTED
HIMSELF
WITH
RESTRICTING
HIS
ABLUTIONS
TO
HIS
CHEST
ARMS
AND
HANDS
HE
THEN
DONNED
HIS
WAISTCOAT
AND
TAKING
UP
A
PIECE
OF
HARD
SOAP
ON
THE
WASHSTAND
CENTRE
TABLE
DIPPED
IT
INTO
WATER
AND
COMMENCED
LATHERING
HIS
FACE
I
WAS
WATCHING
TO
SEE
WHERE
HE
KEPT
HIS
RAZOR
WHEN
LO
AND
BEHOLD
HE
TAKES
THE
HARPOON
FROM
THE
BED
CORNER
SLIPS
OUT
THE
LONG
WOODEN
STOCK
UNSHEATHES
THE
HEAD
WHETS
IT
A
LITTLE
ON
HIS
BOOT
AND
STRIDING
UP
TO
THE
BIT
OF
MIRROR
AGAINST
THE
WALL
BEGINS
A
VIGOROUS
SCRAPING
OR
RATHER
HARPOONING
OF
HIS
CHEEKS
THINKS
I
QUEEQUEG
THIS
IS
USING
ROGERSS
BEST
CUTLERY
WITH
A
VENGEANCE
AFTERWARDS
I
WONDERED
THE
LESS
AT
THIS
OPERATION
WHEN
I
CAME
TO
KNOW
OF
WHAT
FINE
STEEL
THE
HEAD
OF
A
HARPOON
IS
MADE
AND
HOW
EXCEEDINGLY
SHARP
THE
LONG
STRAIGHT
EDGES
ARE
ALWAYS
KEPT
THE
REST
OF
HIS
TOILET
WAS
SOON
ACHIEVED
AND
HE
PROUDLY
MARCHED
OUT
OF
THE
ROOM
WRAPPED
UP
IN
HIS
GREAT
PILOT
MONKEY
JACKET
AND
SPORTING
HIS
HARPOON
LIKE

CHAPTER

BREAKFAST
I
QUICKLY
FOLLOWED
SUIT
AND
DESCENDING
INTO
THE
BARROOM
ACCOSTED
THE
GRINNING
LANDLORD
VERY
PLEASANTLY
I
CHERISHED
NO
MALICE
TOWARDS
HIM
THOUGH
HE
HAD
BEEN
SKYLARKING
WITH
ME
NOT
A
LITTLE
IN
THE
MATTER
OF
MY
BEDFELLOW
HOWEVER
A
GOOD
LAUGH
IS
A
MIGHTY
GOOD
THING
AND
RATHER
TOO
SCARCE
A
GOOD
THING
THE
MORES
THE
PITY
SO
IF
ANY
ONE
MAN
IN
HIS
OWN
PROPER
PERSON
AFFORD
STUFF
FOR
A
GOOD
JOKE
TO
ANYBODY
LET
HIM
NOT
BE
BACKWARD
BUT
LET
HIM
CHEERFULLY
ALLOW
HIMSELF
TO
SPEND
AND
BE
SPENT
IN
THAT
WAY
AND
THE
MAN
THAT
HAS
ANYTHING
BOUNTIFULLY
LAUGHABLE
ABOUT
HIM
BE
SURE
THERE
IS
MORE
IN
THAT
MAN
THAN
YOU
PERHAPS
THINK
FOR
THE
BARROOM
WAS
NOW
FULL
OF
THE
BOARDERS
WHO
HAD
BEEN
DROPPING
IN

OF

STILL
FOR

THAT

THESE

JUST
HERE
ARE
OCCASIONED
BY
THE

THAT
AFTER
WE
WERE

SEATED
AT
THE

AND
I
WAS
PREPARING
TO
HEAR
SOME
GOOD
STORIES
ABOUT
WHALING
TO
MY
NO

SURPRISE
NEARLY
EVERY
MAN
MAINTAINED
A
PROFOUND
SILENCE
AND
NOT

THAT
BUT
THEY
LOOKED
EMBARRASSED
YES
HERE
WERE
A
SET
OF
SEADOGS
MANY
OF
WHOM
WITHOUT

BASHFULNESS
HAD

ON

DUELLED

DEAD
WITHOUT

HERE
THEY
SAT
AT

OF
THE

CALLING
ALL
OF
KINDRED
TASTESLOOKING
ROUND
AS
SHEEPISHLY
AT

NEVER

AS
FOR
QUEEQUEGWHY
QUEEQUEG
SAT
THERE
AMONG

THE

OF
THE

TOO
IT
SO
CHANCED
AS
COOL
AS
AN
ICICLE
TO
BE
SURE
I
CANNOT
SAY
MUCH
FOR
HIS
BREEDING
HIS
GREATEST
ADMIRER
COULD
NOT
HAVE
CORDIALLY
JUSTIFIED
HIS
BRINGING
HIS
HARPOON
INTO

WITH
HIM
AND
USING
IT
THERE
WITHOUT
CEREMONY
REACHING
OVER
THE

WITH
IT
TO
THE
IMMINENT
JEOPARDY
OF
MANY
HEADS
AND
GRAPPLING
THE
BEEFSTEAKS
TOWARDS
HIM
BUT
THAT
WAS
CERTAINLY
VERY
COOLLY
DONE
BY
HIM
AND
EVERY
ONE
KNOWS
THAT
IN
MOST
PEOPLES
ESTIMATION
TO
DO
ANYTHING
COOLLY
IS
TO

IT
GENTEELLY
WE
WILL
NOT

OF

HERE
HOW

WHEN

SEATED
MYSELF

THIS

THE

I
HAD
NOT
BEEN
SEATED
VERY
LONG
ERE
A
MAN
OF
A
CERTAIN
VENERABLE
ROBUSTNESS
ENTERED
IMMEDIATELY
AS
THE
STORMPELTED
DOOR
FLEW
BACK
UPON
ADMITTING
HIM
A
QUICK
REGARDFUL
EYEING
OF
HIM
BY
ALL
THE
CONGREGATION
SUFFICIENTLY
ATTESTED
THAT
THIS
FINE
OLD
MAN
WAS
THE
CHAPLAIN
YES
IT
WAS
THE
FAMOUS
FATHER
MAPPLE
SO
CALLED
BY
THE
WHALEMEN
AMONG
WHOM
HE
WAS
A
VERY
GREAT
FAVOURITE
HE
HAD
BEEN
A
SAILOR
AND
A
HARPOONEER
IN
HIS
YOUTH
BUT
FOR
MANY
YEARS
PAST
HAD
DEDICATED
HIS
LIFE
TO
THE
MINISTRY
AT
THE
TIME
I
NOW
WRITE
OF
FATHER
MAPPLE
WAS
IN
THE
HARDY
WINTER
OF
A
HEALTHY
OLD
AGE
THAT
SORT
OF
OLD
AGE
WHICH
SEEMS
MERGING
INTO
A
SECOND
FLOWERING
YOUTH
FOR
AMONG
ALL
THE
FISSURES
OF
HIS
WRINKLES
THERE
SHONE
CERTAIN
MILD
GLEAMS
OF
A
NEWLY

BLOOMTHE
SPRING
VERDURE
PEEPING
FORTH
EVEN
BENEATH
FEBRUARYS
SNOW
NO
ONE
HAVING
PREVIOUSLY
HEARD
HIS
HISTORY
COULD
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
BEHOLD
FATHER
MAPPLE
WITHOUT
THE
UTMOST
INTEREST
BECAUSE
THERE
WERE
CERTAIN
ENGRAFTED
CLERICAL
PECULIARITIES
ABOUT
HIM
IMPUTABLE
TO
THAT
ADVENTUROUS
MARITIME
LIFE
HE
HAD
LED
WHEN
HE
ENTERED
I
OBSERVED
THAT
HE
CARRIED
NO
UMBRELLA
AND
CERTAINLY
HAD
NOT
COME
IN
HIS
CARRIAGE
FOR
HIS
TARPAULIN
HAT
RAN
DOWN
WITH
MELTING
SLEET
AND
HIS
GREAT
PILOT
CLOTH
JACKET
SEEMED
ALMOST
TO
DRAG
HIM
TO
THE
FLOOR
WITH
THE
WEIGHT
OF
THE
WATER
IT
HAD
ABSORBED
HOWEVER
HAT
AND
COAT
AND
OVERSHOES
WERE
ONE
BY
ONE
REMOVED
AND
HUNG
UP
IN
A
LITTLE
SPACE
IN
AN
ADJACENT
CORNER
WHEN
ARRAYED
IN
A
DECENT
SUIT
HE
QUIETLY
APPROACHED
THE
PULPIT
LIKE
MOST
OLD
FASHIONED
PULPITS
IT
WAS
A
VERY
LOFTY
ONE
AND
SINCE
A
REGULAR
STAIRS
TO
SUCH
A
HEIGHT
WOULD
BY
ITS
LONG
ANGLE
WITH
THE
FLOOR
SERIOUSLY
CONTRACT
THE
ALREADY
SMALL
AREA
OF
THE
CHAPEL
THE
ARCHITECT
IT
SEEMED
HAD
ACTED
UPON
THE
HINT
OF
FATHER
MAPPLE
AND
FINISHED
THE
PULPIT
WITHOUT
A
STAIRS
SUBSTITUTING
A
PERPENDICULAR
SIDE
LADDER
LIKE
THOSE
USED
IN
MOUNTING
A
SHIP
FROM
A
BOAT
AT
SEA
THE
WIFE
OF
A
WHALING
CAPTAIN
HAD
PROVIDED
THE
CHAPEL
WITH
A
HANDSOME
PAIR
OF
RED
WORSTED
MANROPES
FOR
THIS
LADDER

AND
STAINED
WITH
A
MAHOGANY

THE
WHOLE
CONTRIVANCE
CONSIDERING
WHAT
MANNER
OF

IT
WAS
SEEMED
BY
NO
MEANS
IN
BAD
TASTE
HALTING
FOR
AN
INSTANT
AT
THE
FOOT
OF
THE
LADDER
AND
WITH
BOTH
HANDS
GRASPING
THE
ORNAMENTAL
KNOBS
OF
THE
MANROPES
FATHER
MAPPLE
CAST
A
LOOK
UPWARDS
AND
THEN
WITH
A
TRULY
SAILORLIKE
BUT
STILL
REVERENTIAL
DEXTERITY
HAND
OVER
HAND
MOUNTED
THE
STEPS
AS
IF
ASCENDING
THE
MAINTOP
OF
HIS
VESSEL
THE
PERPENDICULAR
PARTS
OF
THIS
SIDE
LADDER
AS
IS
USUALLY
THE
CASE
WITH
SWINGING
ONES
WERE
OF
CLOTHCOVERED
ROPE
ONLY
THE
ROUNDS
WERE
OF
WOOD
SO
THAT
AT
EVERY
STEP
THERE
WAS
A
JOINT
AT
MY
FIRST
GLIMPSE
OF
THE
PULPIT
IT
HAD
NOT
ESCAPED
ME
THAT
HOWEVER
CONVENIENT
FOR
A
SHIP
THESE
JOINTS
IN
THE
PRESENT
INSTANCE
SEEMED
UNNECESSARY
FOR
I
WAS
NOT
PREPARED
TO
SEE
FATHER
MAPPLE
AFTER
GAINING
THE
HEIGHT
SLOWLY
TURN
ROUND
AND
STOOPING
OVER
THE
PULPIT
DELIBERATELY
DRAG
UP
THE
LADDER
STEP
BY
STEP
TILL
THE
WHOLE
WAS
DEPOSITED
WITHIN
LEAVING
HIM
IMPREGNABLE
IN
HIS
LITTLE
QUEBEC
I
PONDERED
SOME
TIME
WITHOUT
FULLY
COMPREHENDING
THE
REASON
FOR
THIS
FATHER
MAPPLE
ENJOYED
SUCH
A
WIDE
REPUTATION
FOR
SINCERITY
AND
SANCTITY
THAT
I
COULD
NOT
SUSPECT
HIM
OF
COURTING
NOTORIETY
BY
ANY
MERE
TRICKS
OF
THE
STAGE
NO
THOUGHT
I
THERE
MUST
BE
SOME
SOBER
REASON
FOR
THIS
THING
FURTHERMORE
IT
MUST
SYMBOLIZE
SOMETHING
UNSEEN
CAN
IT
BE
THEN
THAT
BY
THAT
ACT
OF
PHYSICAL
ISOLATION
HE
SIGNIFIES
HIS
SPIRITUAL
WITHDRAWAL
FOR
THE
TIME
FROM
ALL
OUTWARD
WORLDLY
TIES
AND
CONNEXIONS
YES
FOR
REPLENISHED
WITH
THE
MEAT
AND
WINE
OF
THE

TO
THE

THIS

SEE
IS

STRONGHOLDA
LOFTY

WITH
A
PERENNIAL

WITHIN

WILL
CARRY

INTO

WHERE

DOES
NOT

BUT
ONLY
THE

OF

HE
SKULKS

CADIZ
IS
IN

AS

BY

AS
JONAH
COULD
POSSIBLY
HAVE
SAILED
IN
THOSE
ANCIENT
DAYS
WHEN
THE

WAS

BECAUSE

IN
THIS

STANDS
BEFORE

DOES
HE
HEAR
THAT
HOLLOW
VOICE
THAN
HE
DARTS
A
SCRUTINIZING
GLANCE
WE

WITH
THE

HE
SLOWLY

STILL
INTENTLY
EYEING
HIM
NO

ENOUGH
FOR
ANY
HONEST
MAN
THAT

AS
IF
IT
WERE
A
THING
NOT
TO
BE
OVERLOOKED
IN
THIS
HISTORY
THAT
HE
PAID
THE
FARE
THEREOF
ERE
THE
CRAFT
DID
SAIL
AND
TAKEN
WITH
THE
CONTEXT
THIS
IS
FULL
OF
MEANING
NOW
JONAHS
CAPTAIN
SHIPMATES
WAS
ONE
WHOSE
DISCERNMENT
DETECTS
CRIME
IN
ANY
BUT
WHOSE
CUPIDITY
EXPOSES
IT
ONLY
IN
THE
PENNILESS
IN
THIS
WORLD
SHIPMATES
SIN
THAT
PAYS
ITS

CAN
TRAVEL
FREELY
AND
WITHOUT
A
PASSPORT
WHEREAS
VIRTUE
IF
A
PAUPER
IS
STOPPED
AT
ALL
FRONTIERS
SO
JONAHS
CAPTAIN
PREPARES
TO
TEST
THE
LENGTH
OF
JONAHS
PURSE
ERE
HE
JUDGE
HIM
OPENLY
HE
CHARGES
HIM
THRICE
THE
USUAL
SUM
AND
ITS
ASSENTED
TO
THEN
THE
CAPTAIN
KNOWS
THAT
JONAH
IS
A
FUGITIVE
BUT
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
RESOLVES
TO
HELP
A
FLIGHT
THAT
PAVES
ITS
REAR
WITH
GOLD
YET
WHEN
JONAH
FAIRLY
TAKES
OUT
HIS
PURSE
PRUDENT
SUSPICIONS
STILL
MOLEST
THE
CAPTAIN
HE
RINGS
EVERY
COIN
TO
FIND
A
COUNTERFEIT
NOT
A
FORGER
ANY
WAY
HE
MUTTERS
AND
JONAH
IS
PUT
DOWN
FOR

POINT
OUT
MY
STATEROOM
SIR
SAYS
JONAH
NOW
IM
TRAVELWEARY
I
NEED
SLEEP
THOU
LOOKEST
LIKE
IT
SAYS
THE
CAPTAIN
THERES
THY
ROOM
JONAH
ENTERS
AND
WOULD
LOCK
THE
DOOR
BUT
THE
LOCK
CONTAINS
NO
KEY
HEARING
HIM
FOOLISHLY
FUMBLING
THERE
THE
CAPTAIN
LAUGHS
LOWLY
TO
HIMSELF
AND
MUTTERS
SOMETHING
ABOUT
THE
DOORS
OF
CONVICTS
CELLS
BEING
NEVER
ALLOWED
TO
BE
LOCKED
WITHIN
ALL
DRESSED
AND
DUSTY
AS
HE
IS
JONAH
THROWS
HIMSELF
INTO
HIS
BERTH
AND
FINDS
THE
LITTLE
STATEROOM
CEILING
ALMOST
RESTING
ON
HIS
FOREHEAD
THE
AIR
IS
CLOSE
AND
JONAH
GASPS
THEN
IN
THAT
CONTRACTED
HOLE
SUNK
TOO
BENEATH
THE
SHIPS
WATERLINE
JONAH
FEELS
THE
HERALDING
PRESENTIMENT
OF
THAT
STIFLING
HOUR
WHEN
THE
WHALE
SHALL
HOLD
HIM
IN
THE
SMALLEST
OF
HIS
BOWELS
WARDS
SCREWED
AT
ITS
AXIS
AGAINST
THE
SIDE
A
SWINGING
LAMP
SLIGHTLY
OSCILLATES
IN
JONAHS
ROOM
AND
THE
SHIP
HEELING
OVER
TOWARDS
THE
WHARF
WITH
THE
WEIGHT
OF
THE
LAST
BALES
RECEIVED
THE
LAMP
FLAME
AND
ALL
THOUGH
IN
SLIGHT
MOTION
STILL
MAINTAINS
A
PERMANENT
OBLIQUITY
WITH
REFERENCE
TO
THE
ROOM
THOUGH
IN
TRUTH
INFALLIBLY
STRAIGHT
ITSELF
IT
BUT
MADE
OBVIOUS
THE
FALSE
LYING
LEVELS
AMONG
WHICH
IT
HUNG
THE
LAMP
ALARMS
AND
FRIGHTENS
JONAH
AS
LYING
IN
HIS
BERTH
HIS
TORMENTED
EYES
ROLL
ROUND
THE
PLACE
AND
THIS
THUS
FAR
SUCCESSFUL
FUGITIVE
FINDS
NO
REFUGE
FOR
HIS
RESTLESS
GLANCE
BUT
THAT
CONTRADICTION
IN
THE
LAMP
MORE
AND
MORE
APPALS
HIM
THE
FLOOR
THE
CEILING
AND
THE
SIDE
ARE
ALL
AWRY
OH
SO
MY
CONSCIENCE
HANGS
IN
ME
HE
GROANS
STRAIGHT
UPWARDS
SO
IT
BURNS
BUT
THE
CHAMBERS
OF
MY
SOUL
ARE
ALL
IN
CROOKEDNESS
LIKE
ONE
WHO
AFTER
A
NIGHT
OF
DRUNKEN
REVELRY
HIES
TO
HIS
BED
STILL
REELING
BUT
WITH
CONSCIENCE
YET
PRICKING
HIM
AS
THE
PLUNGINGS
OF
THE
ROMAN
RACEHORSE
BUT
SO
MUCH
THE
MORE
STRIKE
HIS
STEEL
TAGS
INTO
HIM
AS
ONE
WHO
IN
THAT
MISERABLE
PLIGHT
STILL
TURNS
AND
TURNS
IN
GIDDY
ANGUISH
PRAYING
GOD
FOR
ANNIHILATION
UNTIL
THE
FIT
BE
PASSED
AND
AT
LAST
AMID
THE
WHIRL
OF
WOE
HE
FEELS
A
DEEP
STUPOR
STEALS
OVER
HIM
AS
OVER
THE
MAN
WHO
BLEEDS
TO
DEATH
FOR
CONSCIENCE
IS
THE
WOUND
AND
THERES
NAUGHT
TO
STAUNCH
IT
SO
AFTER
SORE
WRESTLINGS
IN
HIS
BERTH
JONAHS
PRODIGY
OF
PONDEROUS
MISERY
DRAGS
HIM
DROWNING
DOWN
TO
SLEEP
AND
NOW
THE
TIME
OF
TIDE
HAS
COME
THE

CASTS
OFF
HER
CABLES
AND
FROM
THE
DESERTED
WHARF
THE
UNCHEERED

FOR

THAT

MY

WAS
THE

THE

WAS
JONAH
BUT
THE

REBELS
HE
WILL
NOT
BEAR
THE
WICKED
BURDEN
A
DREADFUL
STORM
COMES
ON
THE
SHIP
IS
LIKE
TO
BREAK
BUT
NOW
WHEN
THE
BOATSWAIN
CALLS
ALL
HANDS
TO
LIGHTEN
HER
WHEN
BOXES
BALES
AND
JARS
ARE
CLATTERING
OVERBOARD
WHEN
THE
WIND
IS
SHRIEKING
AND
THE
MEN
ARE
YELLING
AND
EVERY
PLANK
THUNDERS
WITH
TRAMPLING
FEET
RIGHT
OVER
JONAHS
HEAD
IN
ALL
THIS
RAGING
TUMULT
JONAH
SLEEPS
HIS
HIDEOUS
SLEEP
HE
SEES
NO
BLACK
SKY
AND
RAGING
SEA
FEELS
NOT
THE
REELING
TIMBERS
AND
LITTLE
HEARS
HE
OR
HEEDS
HE
THE
FAR
RUSH
OF
THE
MIGHTY
WHALE
WHICH
EVEN
NOW
WITH
OPEN
MOUTH
IS
CLEAVING
THE
SEAS
AFTER
HIM
AYE
SHIPMATES
JONAH
WAS
GONE
DOWN
INTO
THE
SIDES
OF
THE
SHIPA
BERTH
IN
THE
CABIN
AS
I
HAVE
TAKEN
IT
AND
WAS
FAST
ASLEEP
BUT
THE
FRIGHTENED
MASTER
COMES
TO
HIM
AND
SHRIEKS
IN
HIS
DEAD
EAR
WHAT
MEANEST
THOU
O
SLEEPER
ARISE
STARTLED
FROM
HIS
LETHARGY
BY
THAT
DIREFUL
CRY
JONAH
STAGGERS
TO
HIS
FEET
AND
STUMBLING
TO
THE
DECK
GRASPS
A
SHROUD
TO
LOOK
OUT
UPON
THE
SEA
BUT
AT
THAT
MOMENT
HE
IS
SPRUNG
UPON
BY
A
PANTHER
BILLOW
LEAPING
OVER
THE
BULWARKS
WAVE
AFTER
WAVE
THUS
LEAPS
INTO
THE

AND
FINDING
NO
SPEEDY
VENT
RUNS
ROARING
FORE
AND
AFT
TILL
THE
MARINERS
COME
NIGH
TO
DROWNING
WHILE
YET
AFLOAT
AND
EVER
AS
THE
WHITE
MOON
SHOWS
HER
AFFRIGHTED

FROM
THE
STEEP
GULLIES
IN
THE
BLACKNESS
OVERHEAD
AGHAST
JONAH
SEES
THE
REARING
BOWSPRIT
POINTING
HIGH
UPWARD
BUT
SOON
BEAT
DOWNWARD
AGAIN
TOWARDS
THE
TORMENTED
DEEP
TERRORS
UPON
TERRORS
RUN
SHOUTING
THROUGH
HIS
SOUL
IN
ALL
HIS
CRINGING
ATTITUDES
THE
GODFUGITIVE
IS
NOW
TOO
PLAINLY
KNOWN
THE
SAILORS
MARK
HIM
MORE
AND
MORE
CERTAIN
GROW
THEIR
SUSPICIONS
OF
HIM
AND
AT
LAST
FULLY
TO
TEST
THE
TRUTH
BY
REFERRING
THE
WHOLE
MATTER
TO
HIGH
HEAVEN
THEY
FALL
TO
CASTING
LOTS
TO
SEE
FOR
WHOSE
CAUSE
THIS
GREAT
TEMPEST
WAS
UPON
THEM
THE
LOT
IS
JONAHS
THAT
DISCOVERED
THEN
HOW
FURIOUSLY
THEY
MOB
HIM
WITH
THEIR
QUESTIONS
WHAT
IS
THINE
OCCUPATION
WHENCE
COMEST
THOU
THY
COUNTRY
WHAT
PEOPLE
BUT
MARK
NOW
MY
SHIPMATES
THE
BEHAVIOR
OF
POOR
JONAH
THE
EAGER
MARINERS
BUT
ASK
HIM
WHO
HE
IS
AND
WHERE
FROM
WHEREAS
THEY
NOT
ONLY
RECEIVE
AN
ANSWER
TO
THOSE
QUESTIONS
BUT
LIKEWISE
ANOTHER
ANSWER
TO
A
QUESTION
NOT
PUT
BY
THEM
BUT
THE
UNSOLICITED
ANSWER
IS
FORCED
FROM
JONAH
BY
THE
HARD
HAND
OF
GOD
THAT
IS
UPON
HIM
I
AM
A
HEBREW
HE
CRIESAND
THENI
FEAR
THE
LORD
THE
GOD
OF
HEAVEN
WHO
HATH
MADE
THE
SEA
AND
THE
DRY
LAND
FEAR
HIM
O
JONAH
AYE
WELL
MIGHTEST
THOU
FEAR
THE
LORD
GOD
THEN
STRAIGHTWAY
HE
NOW
GOES
ON
TO
MAKE
A
FULL
CONFESSION
WHEREUPON
THE
MARINERS
BECAME
MORE
AND
MORE
APPALLED
BUT
STILL
ARE
PITIFUL
FOR
WHEN
JONAH
NOT
YET
SUPPLICATING
GOD
FOR
MERCY
SINCE
HE
BUT
TOO
WELL
KNEW
THE
DARKNESS
OF
HIS
DESERTSWHEN
WRETCHED
JONAH
CRIES
OUT
TO
THEM
TO
TAKE
HIM
AND
CAST
HIM
FORTH
INTO
THE
SEA
FOR
HE
KNEW
THAT
FOR
HIS
SAKE
THIS
GREAT
TEMPEST
WAS
UPON
THEM
THEY
MERCIFULLY
TURN
FROM
HIM
AND
SEEK
BY
OTHER
MEANS
TO
SAVE
THE
SHIP
BUT
ALL
IN
VAIN
THE
INDIGNANT
GALE
HOWLS
LOUDER
THEN
WITH
ONE
HAND
RAISED
INVOKINGLY
TO
GOD
WITH
THE
OTHER
THEY
NOT
UNRELUCTANTLY
LAY
HOLD
OF
JONAH
AND
NOW
BEHOLD
JONAH
TAKEN
UP
AS
AN
ANCHOR
AND
DROPPED
INTO
THE
SEA
WHEN
INSTANTLY
AN
OILY
CALMNESS
FLOATS
OUT
FROM
THE
EAST
AND
THE
SEA
IS
STILL
AS
JONAH
CARRIES
DOWN
THE
GALE
WITH
HIM
LEAVING
SMOOTH
WATER
BEHIND
HE
GOES
DOWN
IN
THE
WHIRLING
HEART
OF
SUCH
A
MASTERLESS
COMMOTION
THAT
HE
SCARCE
HEEDS
THE
MOMENT
WHEN
HE
DROPS
SEETHING
INTO
THE
YAWNING
JAWS
AWAITING
HIM
AND
THE
WHALE
SHOOTSTO
ALL
HIS
IVORY
TEETH
LIKE
SO
MANY
WHITE
BOLTS
UPON
HIS
PRISON
THEN
JONAH
PRAYED
UNTO
THE
LORD
OUT
OF
THE
FISHS
BELLY
BUT
OBSERVE
HIS
PRAYER
AND
LEARN
A
WEIGHTY
LESSON
FOR
SINFUL
AS
HE
IS
JONAH
DOES
NOT
WEEP
AND
WAIL
FOR
DIRECT
DELIVERANCE
HE
FEELS
THAT
HIS
DREADFUL
PUNISHMENT
IS
JUST
HE
LEAVES
ALL
HIS
DELIVERANCE
TO
GOD
CONTENTING
HIMSELF
WITH
THIS
THAT
SPITE
OF
ALL
HIS
PAINS
AND
PANGS
HE
WILL
STILL
LOOK
TOWARDS
HIS
HOLY
TEMPLE
AND
HERE
SHIPMATES
IS
TRUE
AND
FAITHFUL
REPENTANCE
NOT
CLAMOROUS
FOR
PARDON
BUT
GRATEFUL
FOR
PUNISHMENT
AND
HOW
PLEASING
TO
GOD
WAS
THIS
CONDUCT
IN
JONAH
IS
SHOWN
IN
THE
EVENTUAL
DELIVERANCE
OF
HIM
FROM
THE
SEA
AND
THE
WHALE
SHIPMATES
I
DO
NOT
PLACE
JONAH
BEFORE
YOU
TO
BE
COPIED
FOR
HIS
SIN
BUT
I
DO
PLACE
HIM
BEFORE
YOU
AS
A
MODEL
FOR
REPENTANCE
SIN
NOT
BUT
IF
YOU
DO
TAKE
HEED
TO
REPENT
OF
IT
LIKE
JONAH
WHILE
HE
WAS
SPEAKING
THESE
WORDS
THE
HOWLING
OF
THE
SHRIEKING
SLANTING
STORM
WITHOUT
SEEMED
TO
ADD
NEW
POWER
TO
THE
PREACHER
WHO
WHEN
DESCRIBING
JONAHS
SEASTORM
SEEMED
TOSSED
BY
A
STORM
HIMSELF
HIS
DEEP
CHEST
HEAVED
AS
WITH
A
GROUNDSWELL
HIS
TOSSED
ARMS
SEEMED
THE
WARRING
ELEMENTS
AT
WORK
AND
THE
THUNDERS
THAT
ROLLED
AWAY
FROM
OFF
HIS
SWARTHY
BROW
AND
THE
LIGHT
LEAPING
FROM
HIS
EYE
MADE
ALL
HIS
SIMPLE
HEARERS
LOOK
ON
HIM
WITH
A
QUICK
FEAR
THAT
WAS
STRANGE
TO
THEM
THERE
NOW
CAME
A
LULL
IN
HIS
LOOK
AS
HE
SILENTLY
TURNED
OVER
THE
LEAVES
OF
THE
BOOK
ONCE
MORE
AND
AT
LAST
STANDING
MOTIONLESS
WITH
CLOSED
EYES
FOR
THE
MOMENT
SEEMED
COMMUNING
WITH
GOD
AND
HIMSELF
BUT
AGAIN
HE
LEANED
OVER
TOWARDS
THE
PEOPLE
AND
BOWING
HIS
HEAD
LOWLY
WITH
AN
ASPECT
OF
THE
DEEPEST
YET
MANLIEST
HUMILITY
HE
SPAKE
THESE
WORDS
SHIPMATES
GOD
HAS
LAID
BUT
ONE
HAND
UPON
YOU
BOTH
HIS
HANDS
PRESS
UPON
ME
I
HAVE
READ
YE
BY
WHAT
MURKY
LIGHT
MAY
BE
MINE
THE
LESSON
THAT
JONAH
TEACHES
TO
ALL
SINNERS
AND
THEREFORE
TO
YE
AND
STILL
MORE
TO
ME
FOR
I
AM
A
GREATER
SINNER
THAN
YE
AND
NOW
HOW
GLADLY
WOULD
I
COME
DOWN
FROM
THIS
MASTHEAD
AND
SIT
ON
THE
HATCHES
THERE
WHERE
YOU
SIT
AND
LISTEN
AS
YOU
LISTEN
WHILE
SOME
ONE
OF
YOU
READS
ME
THAT
OTHER
AND
MORE
AWFUL
LESSON
WHICH
JONAH
TEACHES
TO

AS
A

NEVER

TO

OF

AND
WITH
SWIFT

LEAVE
ETERNITY
TO
THEE
FOR
WHAT
IS
MAN
THAT
HE
SHOULD
LIVE
OUT
THE
LIFETIME
OF
HIS
GOD
HE
SAID
NO
MORE
BUT
SLOWLY
WAVING
A
BENEDICTION
COVERED
HIS
FACE
WITH
HIS
HANDS
AND
SO
REMAINED
KNEELING
TILL
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
HAD
DEPARTED
AND
HE
WAS
LEFT
ALONE
IN
THE
PLACE
CHAPTER
10
A
BOSOM
FRIEND
RETURNING
TO
THE
SPOUTERINN
FROM
THE
CHAPEL
I
FOUND
QUEEQUEG
THERE
QUITE
ALONE
HE
HAVING
LEFT
THE
CHAPEL
BEFORE
THE
BENEDICTION
SOME
TIME
HE
WAS
SITTING
ON
A
BENCH
BEFORE
THE
FIRE
WITH
HIS
FEET
ON
THE
STOVE
HEARTH
AND
IN
ONE
HAND
WAS
HOLDING
CLOSE
UP
TO
HIS
FACE
THAT
LITTLE
NEGRO
IDOL
OF
HIS
PEERING
HARD
INTO
ITS
FACE
AND
WITH
A
JACKKNIFE
GENTLY
WHITTLING
AWAY
AT
ITS
NOSE
MEANWHILE
HUMMING
TO
HIMSELF
IN
HIS
HEATHENISH
WAY
BUT
BEING
NOW
INTERRUPTED
HE
PUT
UP
THE
IMAGE
AND
PRETTY
SOON
GOING
TO
THE
TABLE
TOOK
UP
A
LARGE
BOOK
THERE
AND
PLACING
IT
ON
HIS
LAP
BEGAN
COUNTING
THE
PAGES
WITH
DELIBERATE
REGULARITY
AT
EVERY
FIFTIETH
PAGEAS
I
FANCIEDSTOPPING
A
MOMENT
LOOKING
VACANTLY
AROUND
HIM
AND
GIVING
UTTERANCE
TO
A
LONGDRAWN
GURGLING
WHISTLE
OF
ASTONISHMENT
HE
WOULD
THEN
BEGIN
AGAIN
AT
THE
NEXT
FIFTY
SEEMING
TO
COMMENCE
AT
NUMBER
ONE
EACH
TIME
AS
THOUGH
HE
COULD
NOT
COUNT
MORE
THAN
FIFTY
AND
IT
WAS
ONLY
BY
SUCH
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
FIFTIES
BEING
FOUND
TOGETHER
THAT
HIS
ASTONISHMENT
AT
THE
MULTITUDE
OF
PAGES
WAS
EXCITED
WITH
MUCH
INTEREST
I
SAT
WATCHING
HIM
SAVAGE
THOUGH
HE
WAS
AND
HIDEOUSLY
MARRED
ABOUT
THE
FACEAT
LEAST
TO
MY
TASTEHIS
COUNTENANCE
YET
HAD
A
SOMETHING
IN
IT
WHICH
WAS
BY
NO
MEANS
DISAGREEABLE
YOU
CANNOT
HIDE
THE
SOUL
THROUGH
ALL
HIS
UNEARTHLY
TATTOOINGS
I
THOUGHT
I
SAW
THE
TRACES
OF
A
SIMPLE
HONEST
HEART
AND
IN
HIS
LARGE
DEEP
EYES
FIERY
BLACK
AND
BOLD
THERE
SEEMED
TOKENS
OF
A
SPIRIT
THAT
WOULD
DARE
A
THOUSAND
DEVILS
AND
BESIDES
ALL
THIS
THERE
WAS
A
CERTAIN
LOFTY
BEARING
ABOUT
THE
PAGAN
WHICH
EVEN
HIS
UNCOUTHNESS
COULD
NOT
ALTOGETHER
MAIM
HE
LOOKED
LIKE
A
MAN
WHO
HAD
NEVER
CRINGED
AND
NEVER
HAD
HAD
A
CREDITOR
WHETHER
IT
WAS
TOO
THAT
HIS
HEAD
BEING
SHAVED
HIS
FOREHEAD
WAS
DRAWN
OUT
IN
FREER
AND
BRIGHTER
RELIEF
AND
LOOKED
MORE
EXPANSIVE
THAN
IT
OTHERWISE
WOULD
THIS
I
WILL
NOT
VENTURE
TO
DECIDE
BUT
CERTAIN
IT
WAS
HIS
HEAD
WAS
PHRENOLOGICALLY
AN
EXCELLENT
ONE
IT
MAY
SEEM
RIDICULOUS
BUT
IT
REMINDED
ME
OF
GENERAL
WASHINGTONS
HEAD
AS
SEEN
IN
THE
POPULAR
BUSTS
OF
HIM
IT
HAD
THE
SAME
LONG
REGULARLY
GRADED
RETREATING
SLOPE
FROM
ABOVE
THE
BROWS
WHICH
WERE
LIKEWISE
VERY
PROJECTING
LIKE
TWO
LONG
PROMONTORIES
THICKLY
WOODED
ON
TOP
QUEEQUEG
WAS
GEORGE
WASHINGTON
CANNIBALISTICALLY
DEVELOPED
WHILST
I
WAS
THUS
CLOSELY
SCANNING
HIM
HALFPRETENDING
MEANWHILE
TO
BE
LOOKING
OUT
AT
THE
STORM
FROM
THE
CASEMENT
HE
NEVER
HEEDED
MY
PRESENCE
NEVER
TROUBLED
HIMSELF
WITH
SO
MUCH
AS
A
SINGLE
GLANCE
BUT
APPEARED
WHOLLY
OCCUPIED
WITH
COUNTING
THE
PAGES
OF
THE
MARVELLOUS
BOOK
CONSIDERING
HOW
SOCIABLY
WE
HAD
BEEN
SLEEPING
TOGETHER
THE
NIGHT
PREVIOUS
AND
ESPECIALLY
CONSIDERING
THE
AFFECTIONATE
ARM
I
HAD
FOUND
THROWN
OVER
ME
UPON
WAKING
IN
THE
MORNING
I
THOUGHT
THIS
INDIFFERENCE
OF
HIS
VERY
STRANGE
BUT
SAVAGES
ARE
STRANGE
BEINGS
AT
TIMES
YOU
DO
NOT
KNOW
EXACTLY
HOW
TO
TAKE
THEM
AT
FIRST
THEY
ARE
OVERAWING
THEIR
CALM
SELFCOLLECTEDNESS
OF
SIMPLICITY
SEEMS
A
SOCRATIC
WISDOM
I
HAD
NOTICED
ALSO
THAT
QUEEQUEG
NEVER
CONSORTED
AT
ALL
OR
BUT
VERY
LITTLE
WITH
THE
OTHER
SEAMEN
IN
THE
INN
HE
MADE
NO
ADVANCES
WHATEVER
APPEARED
TO
HAVE
NO
DESIRE
TO
ENLARGE
THE
CIRCLE
OF
HIS
ACQUAINTANCES
ALL
THIS
STRUCK
ME
AS
MIGHTY
SINGULAR
YET
UPON
SECOND
THOUGHTS
THERE
WAS
SOMETHING
ALMOST
SUBLIME
IN
IT
HERE
WAS
A
MAN
SOME
TWENTY
THOUSAND
MILES
FROM
HOME
BY
THE
WAY
OF
CAPE
HORN
THAT
ISWHICH
WAS
THE
ONLY
WAY
HE
COULD
GET
THERETHROWN
AMONG
PEOPLE
AS
STRANGE
TO
HIM
AS
THOUGH
HE
WERE
IN
THE
PLANET
JUPITER
AND
YET
HE
SEEMED
ENTIRELY
AT
HIS
EASE
PRESERVING
THE
UTMOST
SERENITY
CONTENT
WITH
HIS
OWN
COMPANIONSHIP
ALWAYS
EQUAL
TO
HIMSELF
SURELY
THIS
WAS
A
TOUCH
OF
FINE
PHILOSOPHY
THOUGH
NO
DOUBT
HE
HAD
NEVER
HEARD
THERE
WAS
SUCH
A
THING
AS
THAT
BUT
PERHAPS
TO
BE
TRUE
PHILOSOPHERS
WE
MORTALS
SHOULD
NOT
BE
CONSCIOUS
OF
SO
LIVING
OR
SO
STRIVING
SO
SOON
AS
I
HEAR
THAT
SUCH
OR
SUCH
A
MAN
GIVES
HIMSELF
OUT
FOR
A
PHILOSOPHER
I
CONCLUDE
THAT
LIKE
THE
DYSPEPTIC
OLD
WOMAN
HE
MUST
HAVE
BROKEN
HIS
DIGESTER
AS
I
SAT
THERE
IN
THAT
NOW
LONELY
ROOM
THE
FIRE
BURNING
LOW
IN
THAT
MILD
STAGE
WHEN
AFTER
ITS
FIRST
INTENSITY
HAS
WARMED
THE
AIR
IT
THEN
ONLY
GLOWS
TO
BE
LOOKED
AT
THE
EVENING
SHADES
AND
PHANTOMS
GATHERING
ROUND
THE
CASEMENTS
AND
PEERING
IN
UPON
US
SILENT
SOLITARY
TWAIN
THE
STORM
BOOMING
WITHOUT
IN
SOLEMN
SWELLS
I
BEGAN
TO
BE
SENSIBLE
OF
STRANGE
FEELINGS
I
FELT
A
MELTING
IN
ME
NO
MORE
MY
SPLINTERED
HEART
AND
MADDENED
HAND
WERE
TURNED
AGAINST
THE
WOLFISH
WORLD
THIS
SOOTHING
SAVAGE
HAD
REDEEMED
IT
THERE
HE
SAT
HIS
VERY
INDIFFERENCE
SPEAKING
A
NATURE
IN
WHICH
THERE
LURKED
NO
CIVILIZED
HYPOCRISIES
AND
BLAND
DECEITS
WILD
HE
WAS
A
VERY
SIGHT
OF
SIGHTS
TO
SEE
YET
I
BEGAN
TO
FEEL
MYSELF
MYSTERIOUSLY
DRAWN
TOWARDS
HIM
AND
THOSE
SAME
THINGS
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
REPELLED
MOST
OTHERS
THEY
WERE
THE
VERY
MAGNETS
THAT
THUS
DREW
ME
ILL
TRY
A
PAGAN
FRIEND
THOUGHT
I
SINCE
CHRISTIAN
KINDNESS
HAS
PROVED
BUT
HOLLOW
COURTESY
I
DREW
MY
BENCH
NEAR
HIM
AND
MADE
SOME
FRIENDLY
SIGNS
AND
HINTS
DOING
MY
BEST
TO
TALK
WITH
HIM
MEANWHILE
AT
FIRST
HE
LITTLE
NOTICED
THESE
ADVANCES
BUT
PRESENTLY
UPON
MY
REFERRING
TO
HIS
LAST
NIGHTS
HOSPITALITIES
HE
MADE
OUT
TO
ASK
ME
WHETHER
WE
WERE
AGAIN
TO
BE
BEDFELLOWS
I
TOLD
HIM
YES
WHEREAT
I
THOUGHT
HE
LOOKED
PLEASED
PERHAPS
A
LITTLE
COMPLIMENTED
WE
THEN
TURNED
OVER
THE
BOOK
TOGETHER
AND
I
ENDEAVORED
TO
EXPLAIN
TO
HIM
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THE
PRINTING
AND
THE
MEANING
OF
THE
FEW
PICTURES
THAT
WERE
IN
IT
THUS
I
SOON
ENGAGED
HIS
INTEREST
AND
FROM
THAT
WE
WENT
TO
JABBERING
THE
BEST
WE
COULD
ABOUT
THE
VARIOUS
OUTER
SIGHTS
TO
BE
SEEN
IN
THIS
FAMOUS
TOWN
SOON
I
PROPOSED
A
SOCIAL
SMOKE
AND
PRODUCING
HIS
POUCH
AND
TOMAHAWK
HE
QUIETLY
OFFERED
ME
A
PUFF
AND
THEN
WE
SAT
EXCHANGING
PUFFS
FROM
THAT
WILD
PIPE
OF
HIS
AND
KEEPING
IT
REGULARLY
PASSING
BETWEEN
US
IF
THERE
YET
LURKED
ANY
ICE
OF
INDIFFERENCE
TOWARDS
ME
IN
THE
PAGANS
BREAST
THIS
PLEASANT
GENIAL
SMOKE
WE
HAD
SOON
THAWED
IT
OUT
AND
LEFT
US
CRONIES
HE
SEEMED
TO
TAKE
TO
ME
QUITE
AS
NATURALLY
AND
UNBIDDENLY
AS
I
TO
HIM
AND
WHEN
OUR
SMOKE
WAS
OVER
HE
PRESSED
HIS
FOREHEAD
AGAINST
MINE
CLASPED
ME
ROUND
THE
WAIST
AND
SAID
THAT
HENCEFORTH
WE
WERE
MARRIED
MEANING
IN
HIS
COUNTRYS
PHRASE
THAT
WE
WERE
BOSOM
FRIENDS
HE
WOULD
GLADLY
DIE
FOR
ME
IF
NEED
SHOULD
BE
IN
A
COUNTRYMAN
THIS
SUDDEN
FLAME
OF
FRIENDSHIP
WOULD
HAVE
SEEMED
FAR
TOO
PREMATURE
A
THING
TO
BE
MUCH
DISTRUSTED
BUT
IN
THIS
SIMPLE
SAVAGE
THOSE
OLD
RULES
WOULD
NOT
APPLY
AFTER
SUPPER
AND
ANOTHER
SOCIAL
CHAT
AND
SMOKE
WE
WENT
TO
OUR
ROOM
TOGETHER
HE
MADE
ME
A
PRESENT
OF
HIS
EMBALMED
HEAD
TOOK
OUT
HIS
ENORMOUS
TOBACCO
WALLET
AND
GROPING
UNDER
THE
TOBACCO
DREW
OUT
SOME
THIRTY
DOLLARS
IN
SILVER
THEN
SPREADING
THEM
ON
THE
TABLE
AND
MECHANICALLY
DIVIDING
THEM
INTO
TWO
EQUAL
PORTIONS
PUSHED
ONE
OF
THEM
TOWARDS
ME
AND
SAID
IT
WAS
MINE
I
WAS
GOING
TO
REMONSTRATE
BUT
HE
SILENCED
ME
BY
POURING
THEM
INTO
MY
TROWSERS
POCKETS
I
LET
THEM
STAY
HE
THEN
WENT
ABOUT
HIS
EVENING
PRAYERS
TOOK
OUT
HIS
IDOL
AND
REMOVED
THE
PAPER
FIREBOARD
BY
CERTAIN
SIGNS
AND
SYMPTOMS
I
THOUGHT
HE
SEEMED
ANXIOUS
FOR
ME
TO
JOIN
HIM
BUT
WELL
KNOWING
WHAT
WAS
TO
FOLLOW
I
DELIBERATED
A
MOMENT
WHETHER
IN
CASE
HE
INVITED
ME
I
WOULD
COMPLY
OR
OTHERWISE
I
WAS
A
GOOD
CHRISTIAN
BORN
AND
BRED
IN
THE
BOSOM
OF
THE
INFALLIBLE
PRESBYTERIAN
CHURCH
HOW
THEN
COULD
I
UNITE
WITH
THIS
WILD
IDOLATOR
IN
WORSHIPPING
HIS
PIECE
OF
WOOD
BUT
WHAT
IS
WORSHIP
THOUGHT
I
DO
YOU
SUPPOSE
NOW
ISHMAEL
THAT
THE
MAGNANIMOUS
GOD
OF
HEAVEN
AND
EARTHPAGANS
AND
ALL
INCLUDEDCAN
POSSIBLY
BE
JEALOUS
OF
AN
INSIGNIFICANT
BIT
OF
BLACK
WOOD
IMPOSSIBLE
BUT
WHAT
IS
WORSHIPTO
DO
THE
WILL
OF
GODTHAT
IS
WORSHIP
AND
WHAT
IS
THE
WILL
OF
GODTO
DO
TO
MY
FELLOW
MAN
WHAT
I
WOULD
HAVE
MY
FELLOW
MAN
TO
DO
TO
METHAT
IS
THE
WILL
OF
GOD
NOW
QUEEQUEG
IS
MY
FELLOW
MAN
AND
WHAT
DO
I
WISH
THAT
THIS
QUEEQUEG
WOULD
DO
TO
ME
WHY
UNITE
WITH
ME
IN
MY
PARTICULAR
PRESBYTERIAN
FORM
OF
WORSHIP
CONSEQUENTLY
I
MUST
THEN
UNITE
WITH
HIM
IN
HIS
ERGO
I
MUST
TURN
IDOLATOR
SO
I
KINDLED
THE
SHAVINGS
HELPED
PROP
UP
THE
INNOCENT
LITTLE
IDOL
OFFERED
HIM
BURNT
BISCUIT
WITH
QUEEQUEG
SALAMED
BEFORE
HIM
TWICE
OR
THRICE
KISSED
HIS
NOSE
AND
THAT
DONE
WE
UNDRESSED
AND
WENT
TO
BED
AT
PEACE
WITH
OUR
OWN
CONSCIENCES
AND
ALL
THE
WORLD
BUT
WE
DID
NOT
GO
TO
SLEEP
WITHOUT
SOME
LITTLE
CHAT
HOW
IT
IS
I
KNOW
NOT
BUT
THERE
IS
NO
PLACE
LIKE
A
BED
FOR
CONFIDENTIAL
DISCLOSURES
BETWEEN
FRIENDS
MAN
AND
WIFE
THEY
SAY
THERE
OPEN
THE
VERY
BOTTOM
OF
THEIR
SOULS
TO
EACH
OTHER
AND
SOME
OLD
COUPLES
OFTEN
LIE
AND
CHAT
OVER
OLD
TIMES
TILL
NEARLY
MORNING
THUS
THEN
IN
OUR
HEARTS
HONEYMOON
LAY
I
AND
QUEEQUEGA
COSY
LOVING
PAIR
CHAPTER
11
NIGHTGOWN
WE
HAD
LAIN
THUS
IN
BED
CHATTING
AND
NAPPING
AT
SHORT
INTERVALS
AND
QUEEQUEG
NOW
AND
THEN
AFFECTIONATELY
THROWING
HIS
BROWN
TATTOOED
LEGS
OVER
MINE
AND
THEN
DRAWING
THEM
BACK
SO
ENTIRELY
SOCIABLE
AND
FREE
AND
EASY
WERE
WE
WHEN
AT
LAST
BY
REASON
OF
OUR
CONFABULATIONS
WHAT
LITTLE
NAPPISHNESS
REMAINED
IN
US
ALTOGETHER
DEPARTED
AND
WE
FELT
LIKE
GETTING
UP
AGAIN
THOUGH
DAYBREAK
WAS
YET
SOME
WAY
DOWN
THE
FUTURE
YES
WE
BECAME
VERY
WAKEFUL
SO
MUCH
SO
THAT
OUR
RECUMBENT
POSITION
BEGAN
TO
GROW
WEARISOME
AND
BY
LITTLE
AND
LITTLE
WE
FOUND
OURSELVES
SITTING
UP
THE
CLOTHES
WELL
TUCKED
AROUND
US
LEANING
AGAINST
THE
HEADBOARD
WITH
OUR
FOUR
KNEES
DRAWN
UP
CLOSE
TOGETHER
AND
OUR
TWO
NOSES
BENDING
OVER
THEM
AS
IF
OUR
KNEEPANS
WERE
WARMINGPANS
WE
FELT
VERY
NICE
AND
SNUG
THE
MORE
SO
SINCE
IT
WAS
SO
CHILLY
OUT
OF
DOORS
INDEED
OUT
OF
BEDCLOTHES
TOO
SEEING
THAT
THERE
WAS
NO
FIRE
IN
THE
ROOM
THE
MORE
SO
I
SAY
BECAUSE
TRULY
TO
ENJOY
BODILY
WARMTH
SOME
SMALL
PART
OF
YOU
MUST
BE
COLD
FOR
THERE
IS
NO
QUALITY
IN
THIS
WORLD
THAT
IS
NOT
WHAT
IT
IS
MERELY
BY
CONTRAST
NOTHING
EXISTS
IN
ITSELF
IF
YOU
FLATTER
YOURSELF
THAT
YOU
ARE
ALL
OVER
COMFORTABLE
AND
HAVE
BEEN
SO
A
LONG
TIME
THEN
YOU
CANNOT
BE
SAID
TO
BE
COMFORTABLE
ANY
MORE
BUT
IF
LIKE
QUEEQUEG
AND
ME
IN
THE
BED
THE
TIP
OF
YOUR
NOSE
OR
THE
CROWN
OF
YOUR
HEAD
BE
SLIGHTLY
CHILLED
WHY
THEN
INDEED
IN
THE
GENERAL
CONSCIOUSNESS
YOU
FEEL
MOST
DELIGHTFULLY
AND
UNMISTAKABLY
WARM
FOR
THIS
REASON
A
SLEEPING
APARTMENT
SHOULD
NEVER
BE
FURNISHED
WITH
A
FIRE
WHICH
IS
ONE
OF
THE
LUXURIOUS
DISCOMFORTS
OF
THE
RICH
FOR
THE
HEIGHT
OF
THIS
SORT
OF
DELICIOUSNESS
IS
TO
HAVE
NOTHING
BUT
THE
BLANKET
BETWEEN
YOU
AND
YOUR
SNUGNESS
AND
THE
COLD
OF
THE
OUTER
AIR
THEN
THERE
YOU
LIE
LIKE
THE
ONE
WARM
SPARK
IN
THE
HEART
OF
AN
ARCTIC
CRYSTAL
WE
HAD
BEEN
SITTING
IN
THIS
CROUCHING
MANNER
FOR
SOME
TIME
WHEN
ALL
AT
ONCE
I
THOUGHT
I
WOULD
OPEN
MY
EYES
FOR
WHEN
BETWEEN
SHEETS
WHETHER
BY
DAY
OR
BY
NIGHT
AND
WHETHER
ASLEEP
OR
AWAKE
I
HAVE
A
WAY
OF
ALWAYS
KEEPING
MY
EYES
SHUT
IN
ORDER
THE
MORE
TO
CONCENTRATE
THE
SNUGNESS
OF
BEING
IN
BED
BECAUSE
NO
MAN
CAN
EVER
FEEL
HIS
OWN
IDENTITY
ARIGHT
EXCEPT
HIS
EYES
BE
CLOSED
AS
IF
DARKNESS
WERE
INDEED
THE
PROPER
ELEMENT
OF
OUR
ESSENCES
THOUGH
LIGHT
BE
MORE
CONGENIAL
TO
OUR
CLAYEY
PART
UPON
OPENING
MY
EYES
THEN
AND
COMING
OUT
OF
MY
OWN
PLEASANT
AND
SELFCREATED
DARKNESS
INTO
THE
IMPOSED
AND
COARSE
OUTER
GLOOM
OF
THE
UNILLUMINATED
TWELVEOCLOCKATNIGHT
I
EXPERIENCED
A
DISAGREEABLE
REVULSION
NOR
DID
I
AT
ALL
OBJECT
TO
THE
HINT
FROM
QUEEQUEG
THAT
PERHAPS
IT
WERE
BEST
TO
STRIKE
A
LIGHT
SEEING
THAT
WE
WERE
SO
WIDE
AWAKE
AND
BESIDES
HE
FELT
A
STRONG
DESIRE
TO
HAVE
A
FEW
QUIET
PUFFS
FROM
HIS
TOMAHAWK
BE
IT
SAID
THAT
THOUGH
I
HAD
FELT
SUCH
A
STRONG
REPUGNANCE
TO
HIS
SMOKING
IN
THE
BED
THE
NIGHT
BEFORE
YET
SEE
HOW
ELASTIC
OUR
STIFF
PREJUDICES
GROW
WHEN
LOVE
ONCE
COMES
TO
BEND
THEM
FOR
NOW
I
LIKED
NOTHING
BETTER
THAN
TO
HAVE
QUEEQUEG
SMOKING
BY
ME
EVEN
IN
BED
BECAUSE
HE
SEEMED
TO
BE
FULL
OF
SUCH
SERENE
HOUSEHOLD
JOY
THEN
I
NO
MORE
FELT
UNDULY
CONCERNED
FOR
THE
LANDLORDS
POLICY
OF
INSURANCE
I
WAS
ONLY
ALIVE
TO
THE
CONDENSED
CONFIDENTIAL
COMFORTABLENESS
OF
SHARING
A
PIPE
AND
A
BLANKET
WITH
A
REAL
FRIEND
WITH
OUR
SHAGGY
JACKETS
DRAWN
ABOUT
OUR
SHOULDERS
WE
NOW
PASSED
THE
TOMAHAWK
FROM
ONE
TO
THE
OTHER
TILL
SLOWLY
THERE
GREW
OVER
US
A
BLUE
HANGING
TESTER
OF
SMOKE
ILLUMINATED
BY
THE
FLAME
OF
THE
NEWLIT
LAMP
WHETHER
IT
WAS
THAT
THIS
UNDULATING
TESTER
ROLLED
THE
SAVAGE
AWAY
TO
FAR
DISTANT
SCENES
I
KNOW
NOT
BUT
HE
NOW
SPOKE
OF
HIS
NATIVE
ISLAND
AND
EAGER
TO
HEAR
HIS
HISTORY
I
BEGGED
HIM
TO
GO
ON
AND
TELL
IT
HE
GLADLY
COMPLIED
THOUGH
AT
THE
TIME
I
BUT
ILL
COMPREHENDED
NOT
A
FEW
OF
HIS
WORDS
YET
SUBSEQUENT
DISCLOSURES
WHEN
I
HAD
BECOME
MORE
FAMILIAR
WITH
HIS
BROKEN
PHRASEOLOGY
NOW
ENABLE
ME
TO
PRESENT
THE
WHOLE
STORY
SUCH
AS
IT
MAY
PROVE
IN
THE
MERE
SKELETON
I
GIVE
CHAPTER
12
BIOGRAPHICAL
QUEEQUEG
WAS
A
NATIVE
OF
ROKOVOKO
AN
ISLAND
FAR
AWAY
TO
THE
WEST
AND
SOUTH
IT
IS
NOT
DOWN
IN
ANY
MAP
TRUE
PLACES
NEVER
ARE
WHEN
A
NEWHATCHED
SAVAGE
RUNNING
WILD
ABOUT
HIS
NATIVE
WOODLANDS
IN
A
GRASS
CLOUT
FOLLOWED
BY
THE
NIBBLING
GOATS
AS
IF
HE
WERE
A
GREEN
SAPLING
EVEN
THEN
IN
QUEEQUEGS
AMBITIOUS
SOUL
LURKED
A
STRONG
DESIRE
TO
SEE
SOMETHING
MORE
OF
CHRISTENDOM
THAN
A
SPECIMEN
WHALER
OR
TWO
HIS
FATHER
WAS
A
HIGH
CHIEF
A
KING
HIS
UNCLE
A
HIGH
PRIEST
AND
ON
THE
MATERNAL
SIDE
HE
BOASTED
AUNTS
WHO

VISITED

SPURNED
HIS

AND
NOT

THE

HIS

INFLUENCE
COULD
PREVAIL
BUT
QUEEQUEG
VOWED
A
VOW
ALONE
IN

HE
PADDLED
OFF
TO
A
DISTANT
STRAIT
WHICH
HE
KNEW
THE

MUST
PASS
THROUGH
WHEN
SHE
QUITTED
THE

ON
ONE

WAS
A
CORAL
REEF
ON
THE

A

TONGUE
OF

COVERED
WITH

THICKETS
THAT
GREW
OUT

WITH

HE
SAT
DOWN

WHEN

OF

CLIMBED
UP

AND
THROWING
HIMSELF
AT

UPON

GRAPPLED
A

AND
SWORE
NOT

HACKED
IN

IN

THE

THREATENED
TO
THROW
HIM
OVERBOARD
SUSPENDED
A

OVER

QUEEQUEG
WAS
THE

BUDGED
NOT

BY

DESPERATE
DAUNTLESSNESS
AND
HIS
WILD
DESIRE
TO

THE

AT

RELENTED
AND
TOLD

NEVER

CABIN
THEY
PUT
HIM
DOWN
AMONG

OF

PETER
CONTENT
TO

IN

QUEEQUEG
DISDAINED
NO

IGNOMINY
IF

THE

WHEREBY
TO
MAKE
HIS

STILL
HAPPIER
THAN
THEY
WERE
AND
MORE
THAN
THAT
STILL
BETTER
THAN
THEY
WERE
BUT
ALAS
THE
PRACTICES
OF
WHALEMEN
SOON
CONVINCED
HIM
THAT
EVEN
CHRISTIANS
COULD
BE
BOTH
MISERABLE
AND
WICKED
INFINITELY
MORE
SO
THAN
ALL
HIS
FATHERS
HEATHENS
ARRIVED
AT

IN

HARBOR
AND
SEEING
WHAT
THE

DID
THERE
AND
THEN
GOING

AND
SEEING
HOW
THEY
SPENT
THEIR
WAGES
IN
THAT
PLACE
ALSO
POOR
QUEEQUEG
GAVE
IT
UP
FOR
LOST
THOUGHT
HE
ITS
A

WORLD
IN

MERIDIANS
ILL
DIE
A

AND
THUS
AN
OLD
IDOLATOR
AT

HE
YET
LIVED
AMONG
THESE
CHRISTIANS
WORE
THEIR

AND
TRIED
TO
TALK
THEIR
GIBBERISH
HENCE
THE
QUEER
WAYS
ABOUT
HIM
THOUGH
NOW
SOME
TIME
FROM

BY
HINTS
I
ASKED
HIM
WHETHER
HE
DID
NOT
PROPOSE
GOING
BACK
AND
HAVING
A
CORONATION
SINCE
HE
MIGHT
NOW
CONSIDER
HIS
FATHER
DEAD
AND
GONE
HE
BEING
VERY
OLD
AND
FEEBLE
AT
THE
LAST
ACCOUNTS
HE
ANSWERED
NO
NOT

AND
ADDED
THAT
HE
WAS
FEARFUL
CHRISTIANITY
OR
RATHER
CHRISTIANS
HAD
UNFITTED
HIM
FOR
ASCENDING
THE
PURE
AND
UNDEFILED
THRONE
OF
THIRTY
PAGAN
KINGS
BEFORE
HIM
BUT
BY
AND
BY
HE
SAID
HE
WOULD
RETURNAS
SOON
AS
HE
FELT
HIMSELF
BAPTIZED
AGAIN
FOR
THE
NONCE
HOWEVER
HE
PROPOSED
TO
SAIL
ABOUT
AND
SOW
HIS
WILD
OATS
IN
ALL

THEY
HAD
MADE
A
HARPOONEER
OF
HIM
AND
THAT
BARBED
IRON
WAS
IN
LIEU
OF
A
SCEPTRE
NOW
I
ASKED
HIM
WHAT
MIGHT
BE
HIS
IMMEDIATE
PURPOSE
TOUCHING
HIS
FUTURE
MOVEMENTS
HE
ANSWERED
TO
GO
TO
SEA
AGAIN
IN
HIS
OLD
VOCATION
UPON
THIS
I
TOLD
HIM
THAT
WHALING
WAS
MY
OWN
DESIGN
AND
INFORMED
HIM
OF
MY
INTENTION
TO
SAIL
OUT
OF

AS
BEING
THE

PORT
FOR
AN

JOYOUSLY
ASSENTED
FOR

THE

I
NOW
FELT
FOR
QUEEQUEG
HE
WAS
AN

AND
AS
SUCH
COULD
NOT
FAIL
TO
BE
OF
GREAT
USEFULNESS
TO
ONE
WHO
LIKE

THISTLES
THAT
THEY
HAVE
TO

TO
STOP

THAT
PIECES
OF

IT
WAS
QUITE
LATE
IN
THE
EVENING
WHEN
THE
LITTLE
MOSS
CAME
SNUGLY
TO
ANCHOR
AND
QUEEQUEG
AND
I
WENT
ASHORE
SO
WE
COULD
ATTEND
TO
NO
BUSINESS
THAT
DAY
AT
LEAST
NONE
BUT
A
SUPPER
AND
A
BED
THE
LANDLORD
OF
THE
SPOUTERINN
HAD
RECOMMENDED
US
TO
HIS
COUSIN
HOSEA
HUSSEY
OF
THE
TRY
POTS
WHOM
HE
ASSERTED
TO
BE
THE
PROPRIETOR
OF
ONE
OF
THE
BEST
KEPT
HOTELS
IN
ALL
NANTUCKET
AND
MOREOVER
HE
HAD
ASSURED
US
THAT
COUSIN
HOSEA
AS
HE
CALLED
HIM
WAS
FAMOUS
FOR
HIS
CHOWDERS
IN
SHORT
HE
PLAINLY
HINTED
THAT
WE
COULD
NOT
POSSIBLY
DO
BETTER
THAN
TRY
POTLUCK
AT
THE
TRY
POTS
BUT
THE
DIRECTIONS
HE
HAD
GIVEN
US
ABOUT
KEEPING
A
YELLOW
WAREHOUSE
ON
OUR
STARBOARD
HAND
TILL
WE
OPENED
A
WHITE
CHURCH
TO
THE
LARBOARD
AND
THEN
KEEPING
THAT
ON
THE
LARBOARD
HAND
TILL
WE
MADE
A
CORNER
THREE
POINTS
TO
THE
STARBOARD
AND
THAT
DONE
THEN
ASK
THE
FIRST
MAN
WE
MET
WHERE
THE
PLACE
WAS
THESE
CROOKED
DIRECTIONS
OF
HIS
VERY
MUCH
PUZZLED
US
AT
FIRST
ESPECIALLY
AS
AT
THE
OUTSET
QUEEQUEG
INSISTED
THAT
THE
YELLOW
WAREHOUSEOUR
FIRST
POINT
OF
DEPARTUREMUST
BE
LEFT
ON
THE
LARBOARD
HAND
WHEREAS
I
HAD
UNDERSTOOD
PETER
COFFIN
TO
SAY
IT
WAS
ON
THE
STARBOARD
HOWEVER
BY
DINT
OF
BEATING
ABOUT
A
LITTLE
IN
THE
DARK
AND
NOW
AND
THEN
KNOCKING
UP
A
PEACEABLE
INHABITANT
TO
INQUIRE
THE
WAY
WE
AT
LAST
CAME
TO
SOMETHING
WHICH
THERE
WAS
NO
MISTAKING
TWO
ENORMOUS
WOODEN
POTS
PAINTED
BLACK
AND
SUSPENDED
BY
ASSES
EARS
SWUNG
FROM
THE
CROSSTREES
OF
AN
OLD
TOPMAST
PLANTED
IN
FRONT
OF
AN
OLD
DOORWAY
THE
HORNS
OF
THE
CROSSTREES
WERE
SAWED
OFF
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
SO
THAT
THIS
OLD
TOPMAST
LOOKED
NOT
A
LITTLE
LIKE
A
GALLOWS
PERHAPS
I
WAS
OVER
SENSITIVE
TO
SUCH
IMPRESSIONS
AT
THE
TIME
BUT
I
COULD
NOT
HELP
STARING
AT
THIS
GALLOWS
WITH
A
VAGUE
MISGIVING
A
SORT
OF
CRICK
WAS
IN
MY
NECK
AS
I
GAZED
UP
TO
THE
TWO
REMAINING
HORNS
YES
TWO
OF
THEM
ONE
FOR

TOO
ARE
THESE
LAST
THROWING
OUT
OBLIQUE

I
WAS
CALLED
FROM
THESE
REFLECTIONS
BY
THE
SIGHT
OF
A
FRECKLED
WOMAN
WITH
YELLOW

AND
A
YELLOW
GOWN
STANDING
IN
THE
PORCH
OF
THE
INN
UNDER
A
DULL
RED

SWINGING
THERE
THAT
LOOKED
MUCH
LIKE

ON

CLAM
HOWEVER
A
WARM
SAVORY
STEAM
FROM
THE

SERVED
TO
BELIE
THE
APPARENTLY
CHEERLESS
PROSPECT
BEFORE
US
BUT
WHEN
THAT
SMOKING
CHOWDER
CAME
IN
THE
MYSTERY
WAS
DELIGHTFULLY
EXPLAINED
OH
SWEET
FRIENDS
HEARKEN
TO
ME
IT
WAS
MADE
OF
SMALL
JUICY
CLAMS
SCARCELY
BIGGER
THAN

MIXED
WITH

BISCUIT
AND
SALTED

THE

I
UTTERED

WITH
GREAT
EMPHASIS
AND
RESUMED

WITH
A
DIFFERENT

AND
IN
GOOD

A

WAS
PLACED
BEFORE

WE
RESUMED

AND
WHILE
PLYING
OUR

IN

THINKS
I
TO

I
WONDER
NOW
IF
THIS
HERE
HAS
ANY

ON
THE

WHATS
THAT
STULTIFYING

TO
MY

TO

HAD
TOLD

TWO

SELECTING
OUR

INSTEAD
OF

I
SAY
YOJO
EARNESTLY
ENJOINED
THAT
THE

SHOULD
REST
WHOLLY
WITH

INASMUCH
AS
YOJO
PURPOSED
BEFRIENDING
US
AND
IN

SO
HAD
ALREADY
PITCHED
UPON
A

IF
LEFT

I
ISHMAEL
SHOULD
INFALLIBLY
LIGHT
UPON
FOR
ALL
THE

AS
THOUGH
IT
HAD

OUT
BY

AND
IN
THAT
VESSEL
I
MUST
IMMEDIATELY
SHIP
MYSELF
FOR
THE

IRRESPECTIVE
OF
QUEEQUEG
I
HAVE
FORGOTTEN
TO

IN
THE

OF

NOW
THIS

RATHER
YOJOS
TOUCHING
THE

AS

PRODUCED
NO

UPON

I
WAS
OBLIGED
TO
ACQUIESCE
AND
ACCORDINGLY
PREPARED
TO
SET
ABOUT
THIS

WITH
A
DETERMINED

SORT
OF

TOMAHAWK
PIPE
AND
YOJO
WARMING
HIMSELF
AT
HIS
SACRIFICIAL
FIRE
OF
SHAVINGS
I
SALLIED
OUT
AMONG
THE
SHIPPING
AFTER
MUCH
PROLONGED
SAUNTERING
AND
MANY
RANDOM
INQUIRIES
I
LEARNT
THAT
THERE
WERE
THREE
SHIPS
UP
FOR
THREEYEARS
VOYAGESTHE
DEVILDAM
THE
TITBIT
AND
THE
PEQUOD
DEVILDAM
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
THE
ORIGIN
OF
TITBIT
IS
OBVIOUS
PEQUOD
YOU
WILL
NO
DOUBT
REMEMBER
WAS
THE
NAME
OF
A
CELEBRATED
TRIBE
OF
MASSACHUSETTS
INDIANS
NOW
EXTINCT
AS
THE
ANCIENT
MEDES
I
PEERED
AND
PRYED
ABOUT
THE
DEVILDAM
FROM
HER
HOPPED
OVER
TO
THE
TITBIT
AND
FINALLY
GOING
ON
BOARD
THE
PEQUOD
LOOKED
AROUND
HER
FOR
A
MOMENT
AND
THEN
DECIDED
THAT
THIS
WAS
THE
VERY
SHIP
FOR
US
YOU
MAY
HAVE
SEEN
MANY
A
QUAINT
CRAFT
IN
YOUR
DAY
FOR
AUGHT
I
KNOWSQUARETOED
LUGGERS
MOUNTAINOUS
JAPANESE
JUNKS
BUTTERBOX
GALLIOTS
AND
WHAT
NOT
BUT
TAKE
MY
WORD
FOR
IT
YOU
NEVER
SAW
SUCH
A
RARE
OLD
CRAFT
AS
THIS
SAME
RARE
OLD
PEQUOD
SHE
WAS
A
SHIP
OF
THE
OLD
SCHOOL
RATHER
SMALL
IF
ANYTHING
WITH
AN
OLDFASHIONED
CLAWFOOTED
LOOK
ABOUT
HER
LONG
SEASONED
AND
WEATHERSTAINED
IN
THE
TYPHOONS
AND
CALMS
OF
ALL
FOUR
OCEANS
HER
OLD
HULLS
COMPLEXION
WAS
DARKENED
LIKE
A
FRENCH
GRENADIERS
WHO
HAS
ALIKE
FOUGHT
IN
EGYPT
AND
SIBERIA
HER
VENERABLE
BOWS
LOOKED
BEARDED
HER
MASTSCUT
SOMEWHERE
ON
THE
COAST
OF
JAPAN
WHERE
HER
ORIGINAL
ONES
WERE
LOST
OVERBOARD
IN
A
GALEHER
MASTS
STOOD
STIFFLY
UP
LIKE
THE
SPINES
OF
THE
THREE
OLD
KINGS
OF
COLOGNE
HER
ANCIENT
DECKS
WERE
WORN
AND
WRINKLED
LIKE
THE
PILGRIMWORSHIPPED
FLAGSTONE
IN
CANTERBURY
CATHEDRAL
WHERE
BECKET
BLED
BUT
TO
ALL
THESE
HER
OLD
ANTIQUITIES
WERE
ADDED
NEW
AND
MARVELLOUS
FEATURES
PERTAINING
TO
THE
WILD
BUSINESS
THAT
FOR
MORE
THAN
HALF
A
CENTURY
SHE
HAD
FOLLOWED
OLD
CAPTAIN
PELEG
MANY
YEARS
HER
CHIEFMATE
BEFORE
HE
COMMANDED
ANOTHER
VESSEL
OF
HIS
OWN
AND
NOW
A
RETIRED
SEAMAN
AND
ONE
OF
THE
PRINCIPAL
OWNERS
OF
THE
PEQUODTHIS
OLD
PELEG
DURING
THE
TERM
OF
HIS
CHIEFMATESHIP
HAD
BUILT
UPON
HER
ORIGINAL
GROTESQUENESS
AND
INLAID
IT
ALL
OVER
WITH
A
QUAINTNESS
BOTH
OF
MATERIAL
AND
DEVICE
UNMATCHED
BY
ANYTHING
EXCEPT
IT
BE
THORKILLHAKES
CARVED
BUCKLER
OR
BEDSTEAD
SHE
WAS
APPARELLED
LIKE
ANY
BARBARIC
ETHIOPIAN
EMPEROR
HIS
NECK
HEAVY
WITH
PENDANTS
OF
POLISHED
IVORY
SHE
WAS
A
THING
OF
TROPHIES
A
CANNIBAL
OF
A
CRAFT
TRICKING
HERSELF
FORTH
IN
THE
CHASED
BONES
OF
HER
ENEMIES
ALL
ROUND
HER
UNPANELLED
OPEN
BULWARKS
WERE
GARNISHED
LIKE
ONE
CONTINUOUS
JAW
WITH
THE
LONG
SHARP
TEETH
OF
THE
SPERM
WHALE
INSERTED
THERE
FOR
PINS
TO
FASTEN
HER
OLD
HEMPEN
THEWS
AND
TENDONS
TO
THOSE
THEWS
RAN
NOT
THROUGH
BASE
BLOCKS
OF
LAND
WOOD
BUT
DEFTLY
TRAVELLED
OVER
SHEAVES
OF
SEAIVORY
SCORNING
A
TURNSTILE
WHEEL
AT
HER
REVEREND
HELM
SHE
SPORTED
THERE
A
TILLER
AND
THAT
TILLER
WAS
IN
ONE
MASS
CURIOUSLY
CARVED
FROM
THE
LONG
NARROW
LOWER
JAW
OF
HER
HEREDITARY
FOE
THE
HELMSMAN
WHO
STEERED
BY
THAT
TILLER
IN
A
TEMPEST
FELT
LIKE
THE
TARTAR
WHEN
HE
HOLDS
BACK
HIS
FIERY
STEED
BY
CLUTCHING
ITS
JAW
A
NOBLE
CRAFT
BUT
SOMEHOW
A
MOST
MELANCHOLY
ALL
NOBLE
THINGS
ARE
TOUCHED
WITH
THAT
NOW
WHEN
I
LOOKED
ABOUT
THE
QUARTERDECK
FOR
SOME
ONE
HAVING
AUTHORITY
IN
ORDER
TO
PROPOSE
MYSELF
AS
A
CANDIDATE
FOR
THE
VOYAGE
AT
FIRST
I
SAW
NOBODY
BUT
I
COULD
NOT
WELL
OVERLOOK
A
STRANGE
SORT
OF
TENT
OR
RATHER
WIGWAM
PITCHED
A
LITTLE
BEHIND
THE
MAINMAST
IT
SEEMED
ONLY
A
TEMPORARY
ERECTION
USED
IN
PORT
IT
WAS
OF
A
CONICAL
SHAPE
SOME
TEN
FEET
HIGH
CONSISTING
OF
THE
LONG
HUGE
SLABS
OF
LIMBER
BLACK
BONE
TAKEN
FROM
THE
MIDDLE
AND
HIGHEST
PART
OF
THE
JAWS
OF
THE
RIGHTWHALE
PLANTED
WITH
THEIR
BROAD
ENDS
ON
THE
DECK
A
CIRCLE
OF
THESE
SLABS
LACED
TOGETHER
MUTUALLY
SLOPED
TOWARDS
EACH
OTHER
AND
AT
THE
APEX
UNITED
IN
A
TUFTED
POINT
WHERE
THE
LOOSE
HAIRY
FIBRES
WAVED
TO
AND
FRO
LIKE
THE
TOPKNOT
ON
SOME
OLD
POTTOWOTTAMIE
SACHEMS
HEAD
A
TRIANGULAR
OPENING
FACED
TOWARDS
THE
BOWS
OF
THE
SHIP
SO
THAT
THE
INSIDER
COMMANDED
A
COMPLETE
VIEW
FORWARD
AND
HALF
CONCEALED
IN
THIS
QUEER
TENEMENT
I
AT
LENGTH
FOUND
ONE
WHO
BY
HIS
ASPECT
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
AUTHORITY
AND
WHO
IT
BEING
NOON
AND
THE
SHIPS
WORK
SUSPENDED
WAS
NOW
ENJOYING
RESPITE
FROM
THE
BURDEN
OF
COMMAND
HE
WAS
SEATED
ON
AN
OLDFASHIONED
OAKEN
CHAIR
WRIGGLING
ALL
OVER
WITH
CURIOUS
CARVING
AND
THE
BOTTOM
OF
WHICH
WAS
FORMED
OF
A
STOUT
INTERLACING
OF
THE
SAME
ELASTIC
STUFF
OF
WHICH
THE
WIGWAM
WAS
CONSTRUCTED
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
SO
VERY
PARTICULAR
PERHAPS
ABOUT
THE
APPEARANCE
OF
THE
ELDERLY
MAN
I
SAW
HE
WAS
BROWN
AND
BRAWNY
LIKE
MOST
OLD
SEAMEN
AND
HEAVILY
ROLLED
UP
IN
BLUE
PILOTCLOTH
CUT
IN
THE
QUAKER
STYLE
ONLY
THERE
WAS
A
FINE
AND
ALMOST
MICROSCOPIC
NETWORK
OF
THE
MINUTEST
WRINKLES
INTERLACING
ROUND
HIS
EYES
WHICH
MUST
HAVE
ARISEN
FROM
HIS
CONTINUAL
SAILINGS
IN
MANY
HARD
GALES
AND
ALWAYS
LOOKING
TO
WINDWARDFOR
THIS
CAUSES
THE
MUSCLES
ABOUT
THE
EYES
TO
BECOME
PURSED
TOGETHER
SUCH
EYEWRINKLES
ARE
VERY
EFFECTUAL
IN
A
SCOWL
IS
THIS

MASK
OF
THESE
HALF
HUMOROUS
INNUENDOES
THIS
OLD
SEAMAN
AS
AN
INSULATED
QUAKERISH
NANTUCKETER

DEVOURED
CHEWED
UP
CRUNCHED
BY
THE
MONSTROUSEST
PARMACETTY

A
BOATAH
AH

WAS
A
LITTLE
ALARMED

CONCLUDING
EXCLAMATION
BUT
SAID
AS
CALMLY
AS
I
COULD
WHAT
YOU
SAY
IS
NO
DOUBT
TRUE
ENOUGH
SIR
BUT
HOW
COULD
I
KNOW
THERE
WAS
ANY
PECULIAR
FEROCITY
IN
THAT
PARTICULAR
WHALE
THOUGH
INDEED
I
MIGHT
HAVE
INFERRED
AS
MUCH
FROM
THE
SIMPLE
FACT
OF
THE
ACCIDENT
LOOK
YE
NOW
YOUNG
MAN
THY
LUNGS
ARE
A

OF
SOFT
DYE

THOU
DOST
NOT

MIND
WHAT
I
SAID

SERVICEDONT
AGGRAVATE
MEI
WONT
HAVE
IT
BUT
LET
US
UNDERSTAND
EACH
OTHER
I
HAVE
GIVEN
THEE
A
HINT
ABOUT
WHAT
WHALING
IS
DO
YE
YET
FEEL
INCLINED
FOR
IT
I
DO
SIR
VERY
GOOD
NOW

QUICK
I
AM
SIR
IF
IT

BE
POSITIVELY
INDISPENSABLE
TO

SO
NOT
TO
BE
GOT

OF
THAT
IS
WHICH
I
DONT
TAKE
TO
BE
THE
FACT
GOOD
AGAIN
NOW
THEN
THOU
NOT
ONLY
WANTEST
TO
GO
AWHALING
TO
FIND
OUT
BY

WHAT

BUT
YE
ALSO
WANT
TO
GO
IN
ORDER
TO
SEE
THE
WORLD
WAS
NOT
THAT
WHAT
YE
SAID
I
THOUGHT
SO
WELL
THEN
JUST
STEP
FORWARD
THERE
AND
TAKE
A
PEEP
OVER
THE
WEATHERBOW
AND
THEN
BACK
TO
ME
AND
TELL
ME
WHAT
YE
SEE
THERE
FOR
A
MOMENT
I
STOOD
A
LITTLE
PUZZLED
BY
THIS
CURIOUS
REQUEST
NOT
KNOWING
EXACTLY
HOW
TO
TAKE
IT
WHETHER
HUMOROUSLY
OR
IN
EARNEST
BUT
CONCENTRATING
ALL
HIS
CROWS
FEET
INTO
ONE
SCOWL
CAPTAIN
PELEG
STARTED
ME
ON
THE
ERRAND
GOING
FORWARD
AND
GLANCING
OVER
THE
WEATHER
BOW
I
PERCEIVED
THAT
THE
SHIP
SWINGING
TO
HER
ANCHOR
WITH
THE
FLOODTIDE
WAS
NOW
OBLIQUELY
POINTING
TOWARDS
THE
OPEN
OCEAN
THE
PROSPECT
WAS
UNLIMITED
BUT
EXCEEDINGLY
MONOTONOUS
AND
FORBIDDING
NOT
THE
SLIGHTEST
VARIETY
THAT
I
COULD
SEE
WELL
WHATS
THE
REPORT
SAID
PELEG
WHEN
I
CAME
BACK
WHAT
DID
YE
SEE
NOT
MUCH
I
REPLIEDNOTHING
BUT
WATER
CONSIDERABLE
HORIZON
THOUGH
AND
THERES
A
SQUALL
COMING
UP
I
THINK
WELL
WHAT
DOES
THOU
THINK
THEN
OF
SEEING
THE
WORLD
DO
YE
WISH
TO
GO
ROUND
CAPE
HORN
TO
SEE
ANY
MORE
OF
IT
EH
CANT
YE
SEE
THE
WORLD
WHERE
YOU
STAND
I
WAS
A
LITTLE
STAGGERED
BUT
GO
AWHALING
I
MUST
AND
I
WOULD
AND
THE
PEQUOD
WAS
AS
GOOD
A
SHIP
AS
ANYI
THOUGHT
THE
BESTAND
ALL
THIS
I
NOW
REPEATED
TO
PELEG
SEEING
ME
SO
DETERMINED
HE
EXPRESSED
HIS
WILLINGNESS
TO
SHIP
ME
AND
THOU
MAYEST
AS
WELL
SIGN
THE
PAPERS
RIGHT
OFF
HE
ADDEDCOME
ALONG
WITH
YE
AND
SO
SAYING
HE
LED
THE
WAY
BELOW
DECK
INTO
THE
CABIN
SEATED
ON
THE
TRANSOM
WAS
WHAT
SEEMED
TO
ME
A
MOST
UNCOMMON
AND
SURPRISING
FIGURE
IT
TURNED
OUT
TO
BE
CAPTAIN
BILDAD
WHO
ALONG
WITH
CAPTAIN
PELEG
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
LARGEST
OWNERS
OF
THE
VESSEL
THE
OTHER

AS
IS
SOMETIMES
THE

IN

TO

RETAIN
IN
AN
UNCOMMON

THE
PECULIARITIES
OF
THE
QUAKER

VARIOUSLY
AND
ANOMALOUSLY
MODIFIED
BY
THINGS
ALTOGETHER
ALIEN
AND
HETEROGENEOUS
FOR

OF

THE
MOST
SANGUINARY
OF
ALL

AND
WHALEHUNTERS
THEY
ARE

THEY

WITH

THESE
THINGS
IN
THE
REMINISCENCE
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
BUT
IT
DID
NOT
SEEM
TO
CONCERN
HIM
MUCH
AND
VERY
PROBABLY
HE
HAD
LONG
SINCE
COME
TO
THE
SAGE
AND
SENSIBLE
CONCLUSION
THAT
A
MANS
RELIGION
IS
ONE
THING
AND
THIS
PRACTICAL
WORLD
QUITE
ANOTHER
THIS
WORLD
PAYS
DIVIDENDS
RISING
FROM
A
LITTLE
CABINBOY
IN
SHORT
CLOTHES
OF
THE
DRABBEST
DRAB
TO
A
HARPOONEER
IN
A
BROAD
SHADBELLIED
WAISTCOAT
FROM
THAT
BECOMING
BOATHEADER
CHIEFMATE
AND
CAPTAIN
AND
FINALLY
A
SHIP
OWNER
BILDAD
AS
I
HINTED
BEFORE
HAD
CONCLUDED
HIS
ADVENTUROUS
CAREER
BY
WHOLLY
RETIRING
FROM
ACTIVE
LIFE
AT
THE
GOODLY
AGE
OF
SIXTY
AND
DEDICATING
HIS
REMAINING
DAYS
TO
THE
QUIET
RECEIVING
OF
HIS
WELLEARNED
INCOME
NOW
BILDAD
I
AM
SORRY
TO
SAY
HAD
THE
REPUTATION
OF
BEING
AN
INCORRIGIBLE
OLD
HUNKS
AND
IN
HIS
SEAGOING
DAYS
A
BITTER
HARD
TASKMASTER
THEY
TOLD
ME
IN
NANTUCKET
THOUGH
IT
CERTAINLY
SEEMS
A
CURIOUS
STORY
THAT
WHEN
HE
SAILED
THE
OLD
CATEGUT
WHALEMAN
HIS
CREW
UPON
ARRIVING
HOME
WERE
MOSTLY
ALL
CARRIED
ASHORE
TO
THE
HOSPITAL
SORE
EXHAUSTED
AND
WORN
OUT
FOR
A
PIOUS
MAN
ESPECIALLY
FOR
A
QUAKER
HE
WAS
CERTAINLY
RATHER
HARDHEARTED
TO
SAY
THE
LEAST
HE
NEVER
USED
TO
SWEAR
THOUGH
AT
HIS
MEN
THEY
SAID
BUT
SOMEHOW
HE
GOT
AN
INORDINATE
QUANTITY
OF
CRUEL
UNMITIGATED
HARD
WORK
OUT
OF
THEM
WHEN
BILDAD
WAS
A
CHIEFMATE
TO
HAVE
HIS
DRABCOLOURED
EYE
INTENTLY
LOOKING
AT
YOU
MADE
YOU
FEEL
COMPLETELY
NERVOUS
TILL
YOU
COULD
CLUTCH
SOMETHINGA
HAMMER
OR
A
MARLINGSPIKE
AND
GO
TO
WORK
LIKE
MAD
AT
SOMETHING
OR
OTHER
NEVER
MIND
WHAT
INDOLENCE
AND
IDLENESS
PERISHED
BEFORE
HIM
HIS
OWN
PERSON
WAS
THE
EXACT
EMBODIMENT
OF
HIS
UTILITARIAN
CHARACTER
ON
HIS
LONG
GAUNT
BODY
HE
CARRIED
NO
SPARE
FLESH
NO
SUPERFLUOUS
BEARD
HIS
CHIN
HAVING
A
SOFT
ECONOMICAL
NAP
TO
IT
LIKE
THE
WORN
NAP
OF
HIS
BROADBRIMMED
HAT
SUCH
THEN
WAS
THE
PERSON
THAT
I
SAW
SEATED
ON
THE
TRANSOM
WHEN
I
FOLLOWED
CAPTAIN
PELEG
DOWN
INTO
THE
CABIN
THE
SPACE
BETWEEN
THE
DECKS
WAS
SMALL
AND
THERE
BOLTUPRIGHT
SAT
OLD
BILDAD
WHO
ALWAYS
SAT
SO
AND
NEVER
LEANED
AND
THIS
TO
SAVE
HIS
COAT
TAILS
HIS
BROADBRIM
WAS
PLACED
BESIDE
HIM
HIS
LEGS
WERE
STIFFLY
CROSSED
HIS
DRAB
VESTURE
WAS
BUTTONED
UP
TO
HIS
CHIN
AND
SPECTACLES
ON
NOSE
HE
SEEMED
ABSORBED
IN
READING
FROM
A
PONDEROUS
VOLUME
BILDAD
CRIED
CAPTAIN
PELEG
AT
IT
AGAIN
BILDAD
EH
YE
HAVE
BEEN
STUDYING
THOSE
SCRIPTURES
NOW
FOR
THE
LAST
THIRTY
YEARS
TO
MY
CERTAIN
KNOWLEDGE
HOW
FAR
YE
GOT
BILDAD
AS
IF
LONG
HABITUATED
TO
SUCH
PROFANE
TALK
FROM
HIS
OLD
SHIPMATE
BILDAD
WITHOUT
NOTICING
HIS
PRESENT
IRREVERENCE
QUIETLY
LOOKED
UP
AND
SEEING
ME
GLANCED
AGAIN
INQUIRINGLY
TOWARDS
PELEG
HE
SAYS
HES
OUR
MAN
BILDAD
SAID
PELEG
HE
WANTS
TO
SHIP
DOST
THEE
SAID
BILDAD
IN
A
HOLLOW
TONE
AND
TURNING
ROUND
TO
ME
I
DOST
SAID
I
UNCONSCIOUSLY
HE
WAS
SO
INTENSE
A
QUAKER
WHAT
DO
YE
THINK
OF
HIM
BILDAD
SAID
PELEG
HELL
DO
SAID
BILDAD
EYEING
ME
AND
THEN
WENT
ON
SPELLING
AWAY
AT
HIS
BOOK
IN
A
MUMBLING
TONE
QUITE
AUDIBLE
I
THOUGHT
HIM
THE
QUEEREST
OLD
QUAKER
I
EVER
SAW
ESPECIALLY
AS
PELEG
HIS
FRIEND
AND
OLD
SHIPMATE
SEEMED
SUCH
A
BLUSTERER
BUT
I
SAID
NOTHING
ONLY
LOOKING
ROUND
ME
SHARPLY
PELEG
NOW
THREW
OPEN
A
CHEST
AND
DRAWING
FORTH
THE
SHIPS
ARTICLES
PLACED
PEN
AND
INK
BEFORE
HIM
AND
SEATED
HIMSELF
AT
A
LITTLE
TABLE
I
BEGAN
TO
THINK
IT
WAS
HIGH
TIME
TO
SETTLE
WITH
MYSELF
AT
WHAT
TERMS
I
WOULD
BE
WILLING
TO
ENGAGE
FOR
THE
VOYAGE
I
WAS
ALREADY
AWARE
THAT
IN
THE
WHALING
BUSINESS
THEY
PAID
NO
WAGES
BUT
ALL
HANDS
INCLUDING
THE
CAPTAIN
RECEIVED
CERTAIN
SHARES
OF
THE
PROFITS
CALLED
LAYS
AND
THAT
THESE
LAYS
WERE
PROPORTIONED
TO
THE
DEGREE
OF
IMPORTANCE
PERTAINING
TO
THE
RESPECTIVE
DUTIES
OF
THE
SHIPS
COMPANY
I
WAS
ALSO
AWARE
THAT
BEING
A
GREEN
HAND
AT
WHALING
MY
OWN
LAY
WOULD
NOT
BE
VERY
LARGE
BUT
CONSIDERING
THAT
I
WAS
USED
TO
THE
SEA
COULD
STEER
A
SHIP
SPLICE
A
ROPE
AND
ALL
THAT
I
MADE
NO
DOUBT
THAT
FROM
ALL
I
HAD
HEARD
I
SHOULD
BE
OFFERED
AT
LEAST
THE
275TH
LAYTHAT
IS
THE
275TH
PART
OF
THE
CLEAR
NET
PROCEEDS
OF
THE
VOYAGE
WHATEVER
THAT
MIGHT
EVENTUALLY
AMOUNT
TO
AND
THOUGH
THE
275TH
LAY
WAS
WHAT
THEY
CALL
A
RATHER
LONG
LAY
YET
IT
WAS
BETTER
THAN
NOTHING
AND
IF
WE
HAD
A
LUCKY
VOYAGE
MIGHT
PRETTY
NEARLY
PAY
FOR
THE
CLOTHING
I
WOULD
WEAR
OUT
ON
IT
NOT
TO
SPEAK
OF
MY
THREE
YEARS
BEEF
AND
BOARD
FOR
WHICH
I
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
TO
PAY
ONE
STIVER
IT
MIGHT
BE
THOUGHT
THAT
THIS
WAS
A
POOR
WAY
TO
ACCUMULATE
A
PRINCELY
FORTUNEAND
SO
IT
WAS
A
VERY
POOR
WAY
INDEED
BUT
I
AM
ONE
OF
THOSE
THAT
NEVER
TAKE
ON
ABOUT
PRINCELY
FORTUNES
AND
AM
QUITE
CONTENT
IF
THE
WORLD
IS
READY
TO
BOARD
AND
LODGE
ME
WHILE
I
AM
PUTTING
UP
AT
THIS
GRIM
SIGN
OF
THE
THUNDER
CLOUD
UPON
THE
WHOLE
I
THOUGHT
THAT
THE
275TH
LAY
WOULD
BE
ABOUT
THE
FAIR
THING
BUT
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
SURPRISED
HAD
I
BEEN
OFFERED
THE
200TH
CONSIDERING
I
WAS
OF
A
BROADSHOULDERED
MAKE
BUT
ONE
THING
NEVERTHELESS
THAT
MADE
ME
A
LITTLE
DISTRUSTFUL
ABOUT
RECEIVING
A
GENEROUS
SHARE
OF
THE
PROFITS
WAS
THIS
ASHORE
I
HAD
HEARD
SOMETHING
OF
BOTH
CAPTAIN
PELEG
AND
HIS
UNACCOUNTABLE
OLD
CRONY
BILDAD
HOW
THAT
THEY
BEING
THE
PRINCIPAL
PROPRIETORS
OF
THE
PEQUOD
THEREFORE
THE
OTHER
AND
MORE
INCONSIDERABLE
AND
SCATTERED
OWNERS
LEFT
NEARLY
THE
WHOLE
MANAGEMENT
OF
THE
SHIPS
AFFAIRS
TO
THESE
TWO
AND
I
DID
NOT
KNOW
BUT
WHAT
THE
STINGY
OLD
BILDAD
MIGHT
HAVE
A
MIGHTY
DEAL
TO
SAY
ABOUT
SHIPPING
HANDS
ESPECIALLY
AS
I
NOW
FOUND
HIM
ON
BOARD
THE
PEQUOD
QUITE
AT
HOME
THERE
IN
THE
CABIN
AND
READING
HIS
BIBLE
AS
IF
AT
HIS
OWN
FIRESIDE
NOW
WHILE
PELEG
WAS
VAINLY
TRYING
TO
MEND
A
PEN
WITH
HIS
JACKKNIFE
OLD
BILDAD
TO
MY
NO
SMALL
SURPRISE
CONSIDERING
THAT
HE
WAS
SUCH
AN
INTERESTED
PARTY
IN
THESE
PROCEEDINGS
BILDAD
NEVER
HEEDED
US
BUT
WENT
ON
MUMBLING
TO
HIMSELF
OUT
OF
HIS
BOOK
LAY
NOT
UP
FOR
YOURSELVES
TREASURES
UPON
EARTH
WHERE
MOTH
WELL
CAPTAIN
BILDAD
INTERRUPTED
PELEG
WHAT
DYE
SAY
WHAT
LAY
SHALL
WE
GIVE
THIS
YOUNG
MAN
THOU
KNOWEST
BEST
WAS
THE
SEPULCHRAL
REPLY
THE
SEVEN
HUNDRED
AND
SEVENTYSEVENTH
WOULDNT
BE
TOO
MUCH
WOULD
ITWHERE
MOTH
AND
RUST
DO
CORRUPT
BUT
LAY
LAY
INDEED
THOUGHT
I
AND
SUCH
A
LAY
THE
SEVEN
HUNDRED
AND
SEVENTYSEVENTH
WELL
OLD
BILDAD
YOU
ARE
DETERMINED
THAT
I
FOR
ONE
SHALL
NOT
LAY
UP
MANY
LAYS
HERE
BELOW
WHERE
MOTH
AND
RUST
DO
CORRUPT
IT
WAS
AN
EXCEEDINGLY
LONG
LAY
THAT
INDEED
AND
THOUGH
FROM
THE
MAGNITUDE
OF
THE
FIGURE
IT
MIGHT
AT
FIRST
DECEIVE
A
LANDSMAN
YET
THE
SLIGHTEST
CONSIDERATION
WILL
SHOW
THAT
THOUGH
SEVEN
HUNDRED
AND
SEVENTYSEVEN
IS
A
PRETTY
LARGE
NUMBER
YET
WHEN
YOU
COME
TO
MAKE
A
TEENTH
OF
IT
YOU
WILL
THEN
SEE
I
SAY
THAT
THE
SEVEN
HUNDRED
AND
SEVENTYSEVENTH
PART
OF
A
FARTHING
IS
A
GOOD
DEAL
LESS
THAN
SEVEN
HUNDRED
AND
SEVENTYSEVEN
GOLD
DOUBLOONS
AND
SO
I
THOUGHT
AT
THE
TIME
WHY
BLAST
YOUR
EYES
BILDAD
CRIED
PELEG
THOU
DOST
NOT
WANT
TO
SWINDLE
THIS
YOUNG
MAN
HE
MUST
HAVE
MORE
THAN
THAT
SEVEN
HUNDRED
AND
SEVENTYSEVENTH
AGAIN
SAID
BILDAD
WITHOUT
LIFTING
HIS
EYES
AND
THEN
WENT
ON
MUMBLINGFOR
WHERE
YOUR
TREASURE
IS
THERE
WILL
YOUR
HEART
BE
ALSO
I
AM
GOING
TO
PUT
HIM
DOWN
FOR
THE
THREE
HUNDREDTH
SAID
PELEG
DO
YE
HEAR
THAT
BILDAD
THE
THREE
HUNDREDTH
LAY
I
SAY
BILDAD
LAID
DOWN
HIS
BOOK
AND
TURNING
SOLEMNLY
TOWARDS
HIM
SAID
CAPTAIN
PELEG
THOU
HAST
A
GENEROUS
HEART
BUT
THOU
MUST
CONSIDER
THE
DUTY
THOU
OWEST
TO
THE
OTHER
OWNERS
OF
THIS
SHIPWIDOWS
AND
ORPHANS
MANY
OF
THEMAND
THAT
IF
WE
TOO
ABUNDANTLY
REWARD
THE
LABORS
OF
THIS
YOUNG
MAN
WE
MAY
BE
TAKING
THE
BREAD
FROM
THOSE
WIDOWS
AND
THOSE
ORPHANS
THE
SEVEN
HUNDRED
AND
SEVENTYSEVENTH
LAY
CAPTAIN
PELEG
THOU
BILDAD
ROARED

STARTING
UP
AND
CLATTERING
ABOUT
THE
CABIN
BLAST
YE
CAPTAIN
BILDAD
IF
I
HAD
FOLLOWED
THY
ADVICE
IN
THESE
MATTERS
I
WOULD
AFORE
NOW
HAD
A
CONSCIENCE
TO
LUG
ABOUT
THAT
WOULD
BE
HEAVY
ENOUGH
TO
FOUNDER
THE
LARGEST
SHIP
THAT
EVER
SAILED
ROUND
CAPE

CAPTAIN

BILDAD
STEADILY

CONSCIENCE

OR
TEN
FATHOMS
I
CANT
TELL
BUT
AS
THOU

STILL
AN
IMPENITENT
MAN
CAPTAIN
PELEG
I
GREATLY
FEAR
LEST
THY
CONSCIENCE

BUT
A
LEAKY
ONE
AND
WILL
IN
THE

SINK
THEE

MADE
A
RUSH
AT
BILDAD
BUT
WITH
A
MARVELLOUS
OBLIQUE
SLIDING
CELERITY
BILDAD
FOR
THAT
TIME
ELUDED
HIM
ALARMED
AT
THIS
TERRIBLE
OUTBURST
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
PRINCIPAL
AND
RESPONSIBLE
OWNERS
OF
THE
SHIP
AND
FEELING
HALF
A
MIND
TO
GIVE
UP
ALL
IDEA
OF
SAILING
IN
A
VESSEL
SO
QUESTIONABLY
OWNED
AND
TEMPORARILY
COMMANDED
I
STEPPED
ASIDE
FROM
THE

TO

WHO
I
MADE
NO
DOUBT
WAS
ALL
EAGERNESS
TO
VANISH
FROM
BEFORE
THE
AWAKENED
WRATH
OF
PELEG
BUT
TO
MY
ASTONISHMENT
HE
SAT
DOWN
AGAIN
ON
THE
TRANSOM
VERY
QUIETLY
AND
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
NOT
THE
SLIGHTEST
INTENTION
OF
WITHDRAWING
HE
SEEMED
QUITE
USED
TO
IMPENITENT
PELEG
AND
HIS
WAYS
AS
FOR
PELEG
AFTER
LETTING
OFF
HIS
RAGE
AS
HE
HAD
THERE
SEEMED
NO
MORE
LEFT
IN
HIM
AND
HE
TOO
SAT
DOWN
LIKE
A
LAMB
THOUGH
HE
TWITCHED
A
LITTLE
AS
IF
STILL
NERVOUSLY
AGITATED
WHEW
HE
WHISTLED
AT

WHALES
THAN
I
CAN
COUNT
CAPTAIN
PELEG
WELL
BRING
HIM
ALONG
THEN
AND
AFTER
SIGNING
THE
PAPERS
OFF
I
WENT
NOTHING
DOUBTING
BUT
THAT
I
HAD
DONE
A
GOOD
MORNINGS
WORK
AND
THAT
THE
PEQUOD
WAS
THE
IDENTICAL
SHIP
THAT
YOJO
HAD
PROVIDED
TO
CARRY
QUEEQUEG
AND
ME
ROUND
THE
CAPE
BUT
I
HAD
NOT
PROCEEDED
FAR
WHEN
I
BEGAN
TO
BETHINK
ME
THAT
THE
CAPTAIN
WITH
WHOM
I
WAS
TO
SAIL
YET
REMAINED
UNSEEN
BY

INDEED
IN
MANY
CASES
A
WHALESHIP
WILL
BE
COMPLETELY
FITTED
OUT
AND
RECEIVE
ALL
HER
CREW
ON

ERE
THE
CAPTAIN
MAKES
HIMSELF
VISIBLE
BY
ARRIVING
TO
TAKE
COMMAND
FOR
SOMETIMES
THESE
VOYAGES
ARE
SO
PROLONGED
AND
THE
SHORE
INTERVALS
AT
HOME
SO
EXCEEDINGLY
BRIEF
THAT
IF
THE
CAPTAIN
HAVE
A
FAMILY
OR
ANY
ABSORBING
CONCERNMENT
OF
THAT
SORT
HE
DOES
NOT
TROUBLE
HIMSELF
MUCH
ABOUT
HIS
SHIP
IN
PORT
BUT
LEAVES
HER
TO
THE
OWNERS
TILL
ALL
IS
READY
FOR
SEA
HOWEVER
IT
IS
ALWAYS
AS
WELL
TO
HAVE
A
LOOK
AT
HIM
BEFORE
IRREVOCABLY
COMMITTING
YOURSELF
INTO
HIS
HANDS
TURNING
BACK
I
ACCOSTED
CAPTAIN

THAT
ACCURSED
WHALE

BEEN
A
KIND
OF
MOODYDESPERATE
MOODY
AND
SAVAGE

BUT
THAT
WILL
ALL
PASS
OFF
AND
ONCE
FOR
ALL
LET
ME
TELL
THEE
AND
ASSURE
THEE
YOUNG
MAN
ITS
BETTER
TO
SAIL
WITH
A
MOODY
GOOD
CAPTAIN
THAN
A
LAUGHING
BAD
ONE
SO
GOODBYE
TO
THEEAND
WRONG
NOT
CAPTAIN
AHAB
BECAUSE
HE
HAPPENS
TO
HAVE
A
WICKED
NAME
BESIDES
MY
BOY

HAS
A
WIFENOT
THREE
VOYAGES
WEDDEDA
SWEET

GIRL

OF
THAT
BY
THAT
SWEET
GIRL

THEN
THERE
CAN
BE
ANY
UTTER
HOPELESS
HARM
IN
AHAB
NO
NO
MY
LAD
STRICKEN
BLASTED
IF
HE
BE
AHAB
HAS
HIS
HUMANITIES
AS
I
WALKED
AWAY
I
WAS
FULL
OF
THOUGHTFULNESS
WHAT
HAD
BEEN
INCIDENTALLY
REVEALED
TO
ME
OF
CAPTAIN
AHAB
FILLED
ME
WITH
A
CERTAIN
WILD
VAGUENESS
OF
PAINFULNESS
CONCERNING
HIM
AND
SOMEHOW
AT
THE
TIME
I
FELT
A
SYMPATHY
AND
A
SORROW
FOR
HIM
BUT
FOR
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
UNLESS
IT
WAS
THE
CRUEL
LOSS
OF
HIS
LEG
AND
YET
I
ALSO
FELT
A
STRANGE
AWE
OF
HIM
BUT
THAT
SORT
OF
AWE
WHICH
I
CANNOT
AT
ALL
DESCRIBE
WAS
NOT
EXACTLY
AWE
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
WHAT
IT
WAS
BUT
I
FELT
IT
AND
IT
DID
NOT
DISINCLINE
ME
TOWARDS
HIM
THOUGH
I
FELT
IMPATIENCE
AT
WHAT
SEEMED
LIKE
MYSTERY
IN
HIM
SO
IMPERFECTLY
AS
HE
WAS
KNOWN
TO
ME
THEN
HOWEVER
MY
THOUGHTS
WERE
AT
LENGTH
CARRIED
IN
OTHER
DIRECTIONS
SO
THAT
FOR
THE
PRESENT
DARK
AHAB
SLIPPED
MY
MIND
CHAPTER
17
THE
RAMADAN
AS
QUEEQUEGS
RAMADAN
OR
FASTING
AND
HUMILIATION
WAS
TO
CONTINUE
ALL
DAY
I
DID
NOT
CHOOSE
TO
DISTURB
HIM
TILL
TOWARDS
NIGHTFALL
FOR
I
CHERISH
THE
GREATEST
RESPECT
TOWARDS
EVERYBODYS
RELIGIOUS
OBLIGATIONS
NEVER
MIND
HOW
COMICAL
AND
COULD
NOT
FIND
IT
IN
MY
HEART
TO
UNDERVALUE
EVEN
A
CONGREGATION
OF
ANTS
WORSHIPPING
A
TOADSTOOL
OR
THOSE
OTHER
CREATURES
IN
CERTAIN
PARTS
OF
OUR
EARTH
WHO
WITH
A
DEGREE
OF
FOOTMANISM
QUITE
UNPRECEDENTED
IN
OTHER
PLANETS
BOW
DOWN
BEFORE
THE
TORSO
OF
A
DECEASED
LANDED
PROPRIETOR
MERELY
ON
ACCOUNT
OF
THE
INORDINATE
POSSESSIONS
YET
OWNED
AND
RENTED
IN
HIS
NAME
I
SAY
WE
GOOD
PRESBYTERIAN
CHRISTIANS
SHOULD
BE
CHARITABLE
IN
THESE
THINGS
AND
NOT
FANCY
OURSELVES
SO
VASTLY
SUPERIOR
TO
OTHER
MORTALS
PAGANS
AND
WHAT
NOT
BECAUSE
OF
THEIR
HALFCRAZY
CONCEITS
ON
THESE
SUBJECTS
THERE
WAS
QUEEQUEG
NOW
CERTAINLY
ENTERTAINING
THE
MOST
ABSURD
NOTIONS
ABOUT
YOJO
AND
HIS
RAMADANBUT
WHAT
OF
THAT
QUEEQUEG
THOUGHT
HE
KNEW
WHAT
HE
WAS
ABOUT
I
SUPPOSE
HE
SEEMED
TO
BE
CONTENT
AND
THERE
LET
HIM
REST
ALL
OUR
ARGUING
WITH
HIM
WOULD
NOT
AVAIL
LET
HIM
BE
I
SAY
AND
HEAVEN
HAVE
MERCY
ON
US
ALLPRESBYTERIANS
AND
PAGANS
ALIKEFOR
WE
ARE
ALL
SOMEHOW
DREADFULLY
CRACKED
ABOUT
THE
HEAD
AND
SADLY
NEED
MENDING
TOWARDS
EVENING
WHEN
I
FELT
ASSURED
THAT
ALL
HIS
PERFORMANCES
AND
RITUALS
MUST
BE
OVER
I
WENT
UP
TO
HIS
ROOM
AND
KNOCKED
AT
THE
DOOR
BUT
NO
ANSWER
I
TRIED
TO
OPEN
IT
BUT
IT
WAS
FASTENED
INSIDE
QUEEQUEG
SAID
I
SOFTLY
THROUGH
THE
KEYHOLEALL
SILENT
I
SAY
QUEEQUEG
WHY
DONT
YOU
SPEAK
ITS
IISHMAEL
BUT
ALL
REMAINED
STILL
AS
BEFORE
I
BEGAN
TO
GROW
ALARMED
I
HAD
ALLOWED
HIM
SUCH
ABUNDANT
TIME
I
THOUGHT
HE
MIGHT
HAVE
HAD
AN
APOPLECTIC
FIT
I
LOOKED
THROUGH
THE
KEYHOLE
BUT
THE
DOOR
OPENING
INTO
AN
ODD
CORNER
OF
THE
ROOM
THE
KEYHOLE
PROSPECT
WAS
BUT
A
CROOKED
AND
SINISTER
ONE
I
COULD
ONLY
SEE
PART
OF
THE
FOOTBOARD
OF
THE
BED
AND
A
LINE
OF
THE
WALL
BUT
NOTHING
MORE
I
WAS
SURPRISED
TO
BEHOLD
RESTING
AGAINST
THE
WALL
THE
WOODEN
SHAFT
OF
QUEEQUEGS
HARPOON
WHICH
THE
LANDLADY
THE
EVENING
PREVIOUS
HAD
TAKEN
FROM
HIM
BEFORE
OUR
MOUNTING
TO
THE
CHAMBER
THATS
STRANGE
THOUGHT
I
BUT
AT
ANY
RATE
SINCE
THE
HARPOON
STANDS
YONDER
AND
HE
SELDOM
OR
NEVER
GOES
ABROAD
WITHOUT
IT
THEREFORE
HE
MUST
BE
INSIDE
HERE
AND
NO
POSSIBLE
MISTAKE
QUEEQUEGQUEEQUEGALL
STILL
SOMETHING
MUST
HAVE
HAPPENED
APOPLEXY
I
TRIED
TO

OPEN
THE

IT
STUBBORNLY

I
QUICKLY
STATED

WAS
LOCKED

NOT

VOWING
I

BUT
I
TORE
FROM

A
SUDDEN
BODILY
RUSH

AGAINST

WITH
A
PRODIGIOUS
NOISE
THE
DOOR
FLEW
OPEN
AND
THE
KNOB
SLAMMING
AGAINST
THE

SENT
THE

TO
THE

AND
THERE
GOOD
HEAVENS
THERE
SAT
QUEEQUEG
ALTOGETHER
COOL
AND
SELFCOLLECTED
RIGHT
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
ROOM
SQUATTING
ON
HIS
HAMS
AND
HOLDING
YOJO
ON
TOP
OF
HIS
HEAD
HE
LOOKED
NEITHER
ONE
WAY
NOR
THE
OTHER
WAY
BUT
SAT
LIKE
A
CARVED
IMAGE
WITH
SCARCE
A
SIGN
OF
ACTIVE
LIFE
QUEEQUEG
SAID
I
GOING
UP
TO
HIM
QUEEQUEG
WHATS
THE
MATTER
WITH
YOU
HE
HAINT
BEEN
A
SITTIN
SO
ALL
DAY
HAS
HE
SAID
THE
LANDLADY
BUT
ALL
WE
SAID
NOT
A
WORD
COULD
WE
DRAG
OUT
OF
HIM
I
ALMOST
FELT
LIKE
PUSHING
HIM
OVER
SO
AS
TO
CHANGE
HIS
POSITION
FOR
IT
WAS
ALMOST
INTOLERABLE
IT
SEEMED
SO
PAINFULLY
AND
UNNATURALLY
CONSTRAINED
ESPECIALLY
AS
IN
ALL
PROBABILITY
HE
HAD
BEEN
SITTING
SO
FOR
UPWARDS
OF
EIGHT
OR
TEN
HOURS
GOING
TOO
WITHOUT
HIS
REGULAR
MEALS
MRS
HUSSEY
SAID
I
HES
ALIVE
AT
ALL
EVENTS
SO
LEAVE
US
IF
YOU
PLEASE
AND
I
WILL
SEE
TO
THIS
STRANGE
AFFAIR
MYSELF
CLOSING
THE
DOOR
UPON
THE
LANDLADY
I
ENDEAVORED
TO
PREVAIL
UPON
QUEEQUEG
TO
TAKE
A
CHAIR
BUT
IN
VAIN
THERE
HE
SAT
AND
ALL
HE
COULD
DOFOR
ALL
MY
POLITE
ARTS
AND
BLANDISHMENTSHE
WOULD
NOT
MOVE
A
PEG
NOR
SAY
A
SINGLE
WORD
NOR
EVEN
LOOK
AT
ME
NOR
NOTICE
MY
PRESENCE
IN
THE
SLIGHTEST
WAY
I
WONDER
THOUGHT
I
IF
THIS
CAN
POSSIBLY
BE
A
PART
OF
HIS
RAMADAN
DO
THEY
FAST
ON
THEIR
HAMS
THAT
WAY
IN
HIS
NATIVE
ISLAND
IT
MUST
BE
SO
YES
ITS
PART
OF
HIS
CREED
I
SUPPOSE
WELL
THEN
LET
HIM
REST
HELL
GET
UP
SOONER
OR
LATER
NO
DOUBT
IT
CANT
LAST
FOR
EVER
THANK
GOD
AND
HIS
RAMADAN
ONLY
COMES
ONCE
A
YEAR
AND
I
DONT
BELIEVE
ITS
VERY
PUNCTUAL
THEN
I
WENT
DOWN
TO
SUPPER
AFTER
SITTING
A
LONG
TIME
LISTENING
TO
THE
LONG
STORIES
OF
SOME
SAILORS
WHO
HAD
JUST
COME
FROM
A
PLUMPUDDING
VOYAGE
AS
THEY
CALLED
IT
THAT
IS
A
SHORT
WHALINGVOYAGE
IN
A
SCHOONER
OR
BRIG
CONFINED
TO
THE
NORTH
OF
THE
LINE
IN
THE
ATLANTIC
OCEAN
ONLY
AFTER
LISTENING
TO
THESE
PLUMPUDDINGERS
TILL
NEARLY
ELEVEN
OCLOCK
I
WENT
UP
STAIRS
TO
GO
TO
BED
FEELING
QUITE
SURE
BY
THIS
TIME
QUEEQUEG
MUST
CERTAINLY
HAVE
BROUGHT
HIS
RAMADAN
TO
A
TERMINATION
BUT
NO
THERE
HE
WAS
JUST
WHERE
I
HAD
LEFT
HIM
HE
HAD
NOT
STIRRED
AN
INCH
I
BEGAN
TO
GROW
VEXED
WITH
HIM
IT
SEEMED
SO
DOWNRIGHT
SENSELESS
AND
INSANE
TO
BE
SITTING
THERE
ALL
DAY
AND
HALF
THE
NIGHT
ON
HIS
HAMS
IN
A
COLD
ROOM
HOLDING
A
PIECE
OF
WOOD
ON
HIS
HEAD
FOR
HEAVENS
SAKE
QUEEQUEG
GET
UP
AND
SHAKE
YOURSELF
GET
UP
AND
HAVE
SOME
SUPPER
YOULL
STARVE
YOULL
KILL
YOURSELF
QUEEQUEG
BUT
NOT
A
WORD
DID
HE
REPLY
DESPAIRING
OF
HIM
THEREFORE
I
DETERMINED
TO
GO
TO
BED
AND
TO
SLEEP
AND
NO
DOUBT
BEFORE
A
GREAT
WHILE
HE
WOULD
FOLLOW
ME
BUT
PREVIOUS
TO
TURNING
IN
I
TOOK
MY
HEAVY
BEARSKIN
JACKET
AND
THREW
IT
OVER
HIM
AS
IT
PROMISED
TO
BE
A
VERY
COLD
NIGHT
AND
HE
HAD
NOTHING
BUT
HIS
ORDINARY
ROUND
JACKET
ON
FOR
SOME
TIME
DO
ALL
I
WOULD
I
COULD
NOT
GET
INTO
THE
FAINTEST
DOZE
I
HAD
BLOWN
OUT
THE
CANDLE
AND
THE
MERE
THOUGHT
OF
QUEEQUEGNOT
FOUR
FEET
OFFSITTING
THERE
IN
THAT
UNEASY
POSITION
STARK
ALONE
IN
THE
COLD
AND
DARK
THIS
MADE
ME
REALLY
WRETCHED
THINK
OF
IT
SLEEPING
ALL
NIGHT
IN
THE
SAME
ROOM
WITH
A
WIDE
AWAKE
PAGAN
ON
HIS
HAMS
IN
THIS
DREARY
UNACCOUNTABLE
RAMADAN
BUT
SOMEHOW
I
DROPPED
OFF
AT
LAST
AND
KNEW
NOTHING
MORE
TILL
BREAK
OF
DAY
WHEN
LOOKING
OVER
THE
BEDSIDE
THERE
SQUATTED
QUEEQUEG
AS
IF
HE
HAD
BEEN
SCREWED
DOWN
TO
THE
FLOOR
BUT
AS
SOON
AS
THE
FIRST
GLIMPSE
OF
SUN
ENTERED
THE
WINDOW
UP
HE
GOT
WITH
STIFF
AND
GRATING
JOINTS
BUT
WITH
A
CHEERFUL
LOOK
LIMPED
TOWARDS
ME
WHERE
I
LAY
PRESSED
HIS
FOREHEAD
AGAIN
AGAINST
MINE
AND
SAID
HIS
RAMADAN
WAS
OVER
NOW
AS
I
BEFORE
HINTED
I
HAVE
NO
OBJECTION
TO
ANY
PERSONS
RELIGION
BE
IT
WHAT
IT
MAY
SO
LONG
AS
THAT
PERSON
DOES
NOT
KILL
OR
INSULT
ANY
OTHER
PERSON
BECAUSE
THAT
OTHER
PERSON
DONT
BELIEVE
IT
ALSO
BUT
WHEN
A
MANS
RELIGION
BECOMES
REALLY
FRANTIC
WHEN
IT
IS
A
POSITIVE
TORMENT
TO
HIM
AND
IN
FINE
MAKES
THIS
EARTH
OF
OURS
AN
UNCOMFORTABLE
INN
TO
LODGE
IN
THEN
I
THINK
IT
HIGH
TIME
TO
TAKE
THAT
INDIVIDUAL
ASIDE
AND
ARGUE
THE
POINT
WITH
HIM
AND
JUST
SO
I
NOW
DID
WITH
QUEEQUEG
QUEEQUEG
SAID
I
GET
INTO
BED
NOW
AND
LIE
AND
LISTEN
TO
ME
I
THEN
WENT
ON
BEGINNING
WITH
THE
RISE
AND
PROGRESS
OF
THE
PRIMITIVE
RELIGIONS
AND
COMING
DOWN
TO
THE
VARIOUS
RELIGIONS
OF
THE
PRESENT
TIME
DURING
WHICH
TIME
I
LABORED
TO
SHOW
QUEEQUEG
THAT
ALL
THESE
LENTS
RAMADANS
AND
PROLONGED
HAMSQUATTINGS
IN
COLD
CHEERLESS
ROOMS
WERE
STARK
NONSENSE
BAD
FOR
THE
HEALTH
USELESS
FOR
THE
SOUL
OPPOSED
IN
SHORT
TO
THE
OBVIOUS
LAWS
OF
HYGIENE
AND
COMMON
SENSE
I
TOLD
HIM
TOO
THAT
HE
BEING
IN
OTHER
THINGS
SUCH
AN
EXTREMELY
SENSIBLE
AND
SAGACIOUS
SAVAGE
IT
PAINED
ME
VERY
BADLY
PAINED
ME
TO
SEE
HIM
NOW
SO
DEPLORABLY
FOOLISH
ABOUT
THIS
RIDICULOUS
RAMADAN
OF
HIS
BESIDES
ARGUED
I
FASTING
MAKES
THE
BODY
CAVE
IN
HENCE
THE
SPIRIT
CAVES
IN
AND
ALL
THOUGHTS
BORN
OF
A
FAST
MUST
NECESSARILY
BE
HALFSTARVED
THIS
IS
THE
REASON
WHY
MOST
DYSPEPTIC
RELIGIONISTS
CHERISH
SUCH
MELANCHOLY
NOTIONS
ABOUT
THEIR
HEREAFTERS
IN
ONE
WORD
QUEEQUEG
SAID
I
RATHER
DIGRESSIVELY
HELL
IS
AN
IDEA
FIRST
BORN
ON
AN
UNDIGESTED
APPLEDUMPLING
AND
SINCE
THEN
PERPETUATED
THROUGH
THE
HEREDITARY
DYSPEPSIAS
NURTURED
BY
RAMADANS
I
THEN
ASKED
QUEEQUEG
WHETHER
HE
HIMSELF
WAS
EVER
TROUBLED
WITH
DYSPEPSIA
EXPRESSING
THE
IDEA
VERY
PLAINLY
SO
THAT
HE
COULD
TAKE
IT
IN
HE
SAID
NO
ONLY
UPON
ONE
MEMORABLE
OCCASION
IT
WAS
AFTER
A
GREAT
FEAST
GIVEN
BY
HIS
FATHER
THE
KING
ON
THE
GAINING
OF
A
GREAT
BATTLE
WHEREIN
FIFTY
OF
THE
ENEMY
HAD
BEEN
KILLED
BY
ABOUT
TWO
OCLOCK
IN
THE
AFTERNOON
AND
ALL
COOKED
AND
EATEN
THAT
VERY
EVENING
NO
MORE
QUEEQUEG
SAID
I
SHUDDERING
THAT
WILL
DO
FOR
I
KNEW
THE
INFERENCES
WITHOUT
HIS
FURTHER
HINTING
THEM
I
HAD
SEEN
A
SAILOR
WHO
HAD
VISITED
THAT
VERY
ISLAND
AND
HE
TOLD
ME
THAT
IT
WAS
THE
CUSTOM
WHEN
A
GREAT
BATTLE
HAD
BEEN
GAINED
THERE
TO
BARBECUE
ALL
THE
SLAIN
IN
THE
YARD
OR
GARDEN
OF
THE
VICTOR
AND
THEN
ONE
BY
ONE
THEY
WERE
PLACED
IN
GREAT
WOODEN
TRENCHERS
AND
GARNISHED
ROUND
LIKE
A
PILAU
WITH
BREADFRUIT
AND
COCOANUTS
AND
WITH
SOME
PARSLEY
IN
THEIR
MOUTHS
WERE
SENT
ROUND
WITH
THE
VICTORS
COMPLIMENTS
TO
ALL
HIS
FRIENDS
JUST
AS
THOUGH
THESE
PRESENTS
WERE
SO
MANY
CHRISTMAS
TURKEYS
AFTER
ALL
I
DO
NOT
THINK
THAT
MY
REMARKS
ABOUT
RELIGION
MADE
MUCH
IMPRESSION
UPON
QUEEQUEG
BECAUSE
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
HE
SOMEHOW
SEEMED
DULL
OF
HEARING
ON
THAT
IMPORTANT
SUBJECT
UNLESS
CONSIDERED
FROM
HIS
OWN
POINT
OF
VIEW
AND
IN
THE
SECOND
PLACE
HE
DID
NOT
MORE
THAN
ONE
THIRD
UNDERSTAND
ME
COUCH
MY
IDEAS
SIMPLY
AS

BACK
AS
I
DID
SO
WHO
SHOULD
BE
SEEN
BUT
ELIJAH
FOLLOWING
US
THOUGH
AT
A
DISTANCE
SOMEHOW
THE
SIGHT
OF
HIM
STRUCK
ME
SO
THAT
I
SAID
NOTHING
TO
QUEEQUEG
OF
HIS
BEING
BEHIND
BUT
PASSED
ON
WITH
MY
COMRADE
ANXIOUS
TO
SEE
WHETHER
THE
STRANGER
WOULD
TURN
THE
SAME
CORNER
THAT
WE
DID
HE
DID
AND
THEN
IT
SEEMED
TO
ME
THAT
HE
WAS
DOGGING
US
BUT
WITH
WHAT
INTENT
I
COULD
NOT
FOR
THE
LIFE
OF
ME
IMAGINE
THIS
CIRCUMSTANCE
COUPLED
WITH
HIS
AMBIGUOUS
HALFHINTING
HALFREVEALING
SHROUDED
SORT
OF
TALK
NOW
BEGAT
IN
ME
ALL
KINDS
OF
VAGUE
WONDERMENTS
AND
HALFAPPREHENSIONS
AND
ALL
CONNECTED
WITH
THE
PEQUOD
AND
CAPTAIN
AHAB
AND
THE
LEG
HE
HAD
LOST
AND
THE
CAPE
HORN
FIT
AND
THE
SILVER
CALABASH
AND
WHAT
CAPTAIN
PELEG
HAD
SAID
OF
HIM
WHEN
I
LEFT
THE
SHIP
THE
DAY
PREVIOUS
AND
THE
PREDICTION
OF
THE
SQUAW
TISTIG
AND
THE
VOYAGE
WE
HAD
BOUND
OURSELVES
TO
SAIL
AND
A
HUNDRED
OTHER
SHADOWY
THINGS
I
WAS
RESOLVED
TO
SATISFY
MYSELF
WHETHER
THIS
RAGGED
ELIJAH
WAS
REALLY
DOGGING
US
OR
NOT
AND
WITH
THAT
INTENT
CROSSED
THE
WAY
WITH
QUEEQUEG
AND
ON
THAT
SIDE
OF
IT
RETRACED
OUR
STEPS
BUT
ELIJAH
PASSED
ON
WITHOUT
SEEMING
TO
NOTICE
US
THIS
RELIEVED
ME
AND
ONCE
MORE
AND
FINALLY
AS
IT
SEEMED
TO
ME
I
PRONOUNCED
HIM
IN
MY
HEART
A
HUMBUG
CHAPTER
20
ALL
ASTIR
A
DAY
OR
TWO
PASSED
AND
THERE
WAS
GREAT
ACTIVITY
ABOARD
THE
PEQUOD
NOT
ONLY
WERE
THE
OLD
SAILS
BEING
MENDED
BUT
NEW
SAILS
WERE
COMING
ON
BOARD
AND
BOLTS
OF
CANVAS
AND
COILS
OF
RIGGING
IN
SHORT
EVERYTHING
BETOKENED
THAT
THE
SHIPS
PREPARATIONS
WERE
HURRYING
TO
A
CLOSE
CAPTAIN
PELEG
SELDOM
OR
NEVER
WENT
ASHORE
BUT
SAT
IN
HIS
WIGWAM
KEEPING
A
SHARP
LOOKOUT
UPON
THE
HANDS
BILDAD
DID
ALL
THE
PURCHASING
AND
PROVIDING
AT
THE
STORES
AND
THE
MEN
EMPLOYED
IN
THE
HOLD
AND
ON
THE
RIGGING
WERE
WORKING
TILL
LONG
AFTER
NIGHTFALL
ON
THE
DAY
FOLLOWING
QUEEQUEGS
SIGNING
THE
ARTICLES
WORD
WAS
GIVEN
AT
ALL
THE
INNS
WHERE
THE
SHIPS
COMPANY
WERE
STOPPING
THAT
THEIR
CHESTS
MUST
BE
ON
BOARD
BEFORE
NIGHT
FOR
THERE
WAS
NO
TELLING
HOW
SOON
THE
VESSEL
MIGHT
BE
SAILING
SO
QUEEQUEG
AND
I
GOT
DOWN
OUR
TRAPS
RESOLVING
HOWEVER
TO
SLEEP
ASHORE
TILL
THE
LAST
BUT
IT
SEEMS
THEY
ALWAYS
GIVE
VERY
LONG
NOTICE
IN
THESE
CASES
AND
THE
SHIP
DID
NOT
SAIL
FOR
SEVERAL
DAYS
BUT
NO
WONDER
THERE
WAS
A
GOOD
DEAL
TO
BE
DONE
AND
THERE
IS
NO
TELLING
HOW
MANY
THINGS
TO
BE
THOUGHT
OF
BEFORE
THE
PEQUOD
WAS
FULLY
EQUIPPED
EVERY
ONE
KNOWS
WHAT
A
MULTITUDE
OF
THINGSBEDS
SAUCEPANS
KNIVES
AND
FORKS
SHOVELS
AND
TONGS
NAPKINS
NUTCRACKERS
AND
WHAT
NOT
ARE
INDISPENSABLE
TO
THE
BUSINESS
OF
HOUSEKEEPING
JUST
SO
WITH
WHALING
WHICH
NECESSITATES
A
THREEYEARS
HOUSEKEEPING
UPON
THE
WIDE
OCEAN
FAR
FROM
ALL
GROCERS
COSTERMONGERS
DOCTORS
BAKERS
AND
BANKERS
AND
THOUGH
THIS
ALSO
HOLDS
TRUE
OF
MERCHANT
VESSELS
YET
NOT
BY
ANY
MEANS
TO
THE
SAME
EXTENT
AS
WITH
WHALEMEN
FOR
BESIDES
THE
GREAT
LENGTH
OF
THE
WHALING
VOYAGE
THE
NUMEROUS
ARTICLES
PECULIAR
TO
THE
PROSECUTION
OF
THE
FISHERY
AND
THE
IMPOSSIBILITY
OF
REPLACING
THEM
AT
THE
REMOTE
HARBORS
USUALLY
FREQUENTED
IT
MUST
BE
REMEMBERED
THAT
OF
ALL
SHIPS
WHALING
VESSELS
ARE
THE
MOST
EXPOSED
TO
ACCIDENTS
OF
ALL
KINDS
AND
ESPECIALLY
TO
THE
DESTRUCTION
AND
LOSS
OF
THE
VERY
THINGS
UPON
WHICH
THE
SUCCESS
OF
THE
VOYAGE
MOST
DEPENDS
HENCE
THE
SPARE
BOATS
SPARE
SPARS
AND
SPARE
LINES
AND
HARPOONS
AND
SPARE
EVERYTHINGS
ALMOST
BUT
A
SPARE
CAPTAIN
AND
DUPLICATE
SHIP
AT
THE
PERIOD
OF
OUR
ARRIVAL
AT
THE
ISLAND
THE
HEAVIEST
STORAGE
OF
THE
PEQUOD
HAD
BEEN
ALMOST
COMPLETED
COMPRISING
HER
BEEF
BREAD
WATER
FUEL
AND
IRON
HOOPS
AND
STAVES
BUT
AS
BEFORE
HINTED
FOR
SOME
TIME
THERE
WAS
A
CONTINUAL
FETCHING
AND
CARRYING
ON
BOARD
OF
DIVERS
ODDS
AND
ENDS
OF
THINGS
BOTH
LARGE
AND
SMALL
CHIEF
AMONG
THOSE
WHO
DID
THIS
FETCHING
AND
CARRYING
WAS
CAPTAIN
BILDADS
SISTER
A
LEAN
OLD
LADY
OF
A
MOST
DETERMINED
AND
INDEFATIGABLE
SPIRIT
BUT
WITHAL
VERY
KINDHEARTED
WHO
SEEMED
RESOLVED
THAT
IF
SHE
COULD
HELP
IT
NOTHING
SHOULD
BE
FOUND
WANTING
IN
THE
PEQUOD
AFTER
ONCE
FAIRLY
GETTING
TO
SEA
AT
ONE
TIME
SHE
WOULD
COME
ON
BOARD
WITH
A
JAR
OF
PICKLES
FOR
THE
STEWARDS
PANTRY
ANOTHER
TIME
WITH
A
BUNCH
OF
QUILLS
FOR
THE
CHIEF
MATES
DESK
WHERE
HE
KEPT
HIS
LOG
A
THIRD
TIME
WITH
A
ROLL
OF
FLANNEL
FOR
THE
SMALL
OF
SOME
ONES
RHEUMATIC
BACK
NEVER
DID
ANY
WOMAN
BETTER
DESERVE
HER
NAME
WHICH
WAS
CHARITYAUNT
CHARITY
AS
EVERYBODY
CALLED
HER
AND
LIKE
A
SISTER
OF
CHARITY
DID
THIS
CHARITABLE
AUNT
CHARITY
BUSTLE
ABOUT
HITHER
AND
THITHER
READY
TO
TURN
HER
HAND
AND
HEART
TO
ANYTHING
THAT
PROMISED
TO
YIELD
SAFETY
COMFORT
AND
CONSOLATION
TO
ALL
ON
BOARD
A
SHIP
IN
WHICH
HER
BELOVED
BROTHER
BILDAD
WAS
CONCERNED
AND
IN
WHICH
SHE
HERSELF
OWNED
A
SCORE
OR
TWO
OF
WELLSAVED
DOLLARS
BUT
IT
WAS
STARTLING
TO
SEE
THIS
EXCELLENT
HEARTED
QUAKERESS
COMING
ON
BOARD
AS
SHE
DID
THE
LAST
DAY
WITH
A
LONG
OILLADLE
IN
ONE
HAND
AND
A
STILL
LONGER
WHALING
LANCE
IN
THE
OTHER
NOR
WAS
BILDAD
HIMSELF
NOR
CAPTAIN
PELEG
AT
ALL
BACKWARD
AS
FOR
BILDAD
HE
CARRIED
ABOUT
WITH
HIM
A
LONG
LIST
OF
THE
ARTICLES
NEEDED
AND
AT
EVERY
FRESH
ARRIVAL
DOWN
WENT
HIS
MARK
OPPOSITE
THAT
ARTICLE
UPON
THE
PAPER
EVERY
ONCE
IN
A
WHILE
PELEG
CAME
HOBBLING
OUT
OF
HIS
WHALEBONE
DEN
ROARING
AT
THE
MEN
DOWN
THE
HATCHWAYS
ROARING
UP
TO
THE
RIGGERS
AT
THE
MASTHEAD
AND
THEN
CONCLUDED
BY
ROARING
BACK
INTO
HIS
WIGWAM
DURING
THESE
DAYS
OF
PREPARATION
QUEEQUEG
AND
I
OFTEN
VISITED
THE
CRAFT
AND
AS
OFTEN
I
ASKED
ABOUT
CAPTAIN
AHAB
AND
HOW
HE
WAS
AND
WHEN
HE
WAS
GOING
TO
COME
ON
BOARD
HIS
SHIP
TO
THESE
QUESTIONS
THEY
WOULD
ANSWER
THAT
HE
WAS
GETTING
BETTER
AND
BETTER
AND
WAS
EXPECTED
ABOARD
EVERY
DAY
MEANTIME
THE
TWO
CAPTAINS
PELEG
AND
BILDAD
COULD
ATTEND
TO
EVERYTHING
NECESSARY
TO
FIT
THE
VESSEL
FOR
THE
VOYAGE
IF
I
HAD
BEEN
DOWNRIGHT
HONEST
WITH
MYSELF
I
WOULD
HAVE
SEEN
VERY
PLAINLY
IN
MY
HEART
THAT
I
DID
BUT
HALF
FANCY
BEING
COMMITTED
THIS
WAY
TO
SO
LONG
A
VOYAGE
WITHOUT
ONCE
LAYING
MY
EYES
ON
THE
MAN
WHO
WAS
TO
BE
THE
ABSOLUTE
DICTATOR
OF
IT
SO
SOON
AS
THE
SHIP
SAILED
OUT
UPON
THE
OPEN
SEA
BUT
WHEN
A
MAN
SUSPECTS
ANY
WRONG
IT
SOMETIMES
HAPPENS
THAT
IF
HE
BE
ALREADY
INVOLVED
IN
THE
MATTER
HE
INSENSIBLY
STRIVES
TO
COVER
UP
HIS
SUSPICIONS
EVEN
FROM
HIMSELF
AND
MUCH
THIS
WAY
IT
WAS
WITH
ME
I
SAID
NOTHING
AND
TRIED
TO
THINK
NOTHING
AT
LAST
IT
WAS
GIVEN
OUT
THAT
SOME
TIME
NEXT
DAY
THE
SHIP
WOULD
CERTAINLY
SAIL
SO
NEXT
MORNING
QUEEQUEG
AND
I
TOOK
A
VERY
EARLY

MOMENT
IN
NO

WONDERMENT
AT
HIS
FRANTIC
IMPUDENCE
AT

STEPPING
ON

EVERYTHING
IN
PROFOUND
QUIET
NOT

MOVING
THE

LOCKED
WITHIN
THE
HATCHES

ALL
ON

GOING
FORWARD
TO
THE
FORECASTLE
WE
FOUND
THE
SLIDE
OF
THE
SCUTTLE
OPEN
SEEING
A
LIGHT
WE
WENT
DOWN
AND
FOUND
ONLY
AN
OLD
RIGGER
THERE
WRAPPED
IN
A
TATTERED
PEAJACKET
HE
WAS
THROWN
AT
WHOLE
LENGTH
UPON
TWO
CHESTS

NOT
AT
ALL
NOTICED
WHAT
I
NOW
ALLUDED
TO
HENCE
I
WOULD
HAVE
THOUGHT
MYSELF
TO
HAVE
BEEN
OPTICALLY
DECEIVED
IN
THAT
MATTER
WERE
IT
NOT
FOR
ELIJAHS
OTHERWISE
INEXPLICABLE
QUESTION
BUT
I
BEAT
THE
THING
DOWN
AND
AGAIN
MARKING
THE
SLEEPER
JOCULARLY
HINTED
TO
QUEEQUEG
THAT
PERHAPS
WE
HAD
BEST
SIT
UP
WITH
THE

TELLING
HIM
TO
ESTABLISH
HIMSELF
ACCORDINGLY
HE
PUT
HIS
HAND
UPON
THE
SLEEPERS

FEELING
IF
IT
WAS
SOFT
ENOUGH
AND

WITHOUT

QUESTIONING
HIM
IN
HIS

ME
TO
UNDERSTAND
THAT
IN
HIS
LAND
OWING
TO
THE
ABSENCE
OF
SETTEES
AND
SOFAS
OF
ALL
SORTS
THE
KING
CHIEFS
AND
GREAT
PEOPLE
GENERALLY
WERE
IN
THE
CUSTOM
OF
FATTENING
SOME
OF
THE
LOWER
ORDERS
FOR
OTTOMANS
AND
TO
FURNISH
A
HOUSE
COMFORTABLY
IN
THAT
RESPECT
YOU
HAD
ONLY
TO
BUY
UP
EIGHT
OR
TEN
LAZY
FELLOWS
AND
LAY
THEM
ROUND
IN
THE
PIERS
AND
ALCOVES
BESIDES
IT
WAS
VERY
CONVENIENT
ON
AN
EXCURSION
MUCH
BETTER
THAN
THOSE
GARDENCHAIRS
WHICH
ARE
CONVERTIBLE
INTO
WALKINGSTICKS
UPON
OCCASION
A
CHIEF
CALLING
HIS
ATTENDANT
AND
DESIRING
HIM
TO
MAKE
A
SETTEE
OF
HIMSELF

IN
ITS
TWO

COMPLETELY

SORT
OF
MUFFLEDNESS
THEN

THEN
THE
IDEA
WAS
THAT
HIS
PRESENCE
WAS
BY
NO
MEANS
NECESSARY
IN
GETTING
THE

UNDER

AND
STEERING
HER
WELL
OUT
TO

INDEED
AS
THAT
WAS
NOT
AT
ALL
HIS
PROPER
BUSINESS
BUT
THE

AND
AS
HE
WAS
NOT
YET
COMPLETELY
RECOVEREDSO
THEY
SAIDTHEREFORE
CAPTAIN
AHAB
STAYED
BELOW
AND
ALL
THIS
SEEMED
NATURAL
ENOUGH
ESPECIALLY
AS
IN
THE
MERCHANT
SERVICE
MANY
CAPTAINS
NEVER
SHOW
THEMSELVES
ON
DECK
FOR
A
CONSIDERABLE
TIME
AFTER
HEAVING
UP
THE
ANCHOR
BUT
REMAIN
OVER
THE

TABLE
HAVING
A
FAREWELL
MERRYMAKING
WITH
THEIR
SHORE
FRIENDS
BEFORE
THEY
QUIT
THE
SHIP
FOR
GOOD
WITH
THE
PILOT
BUT
THERE
WAS
NOT
MUCH
CHANCE
TO
THINK
OVER
THE
MATTER
FOR
CAPTAIN
PELEG
WAS
NOW
ALL
ALIVE
HE
SEEMED
TO
DO

OF

INVOLUNTARILY
I
PAUSED
ON

AND
TOLD

TO

THE

THINKING
OF
THE
PERILS
WE
BOTH
RAN
IN
STARTING
ON
THE

WITH
SUCH
A
DEVIL
FOR
A

I
WAS
COMFORTING
MYSELF
HOWEVER
WITH
THE
THOUGHT
THAT
IN
PIOUS
BILDAD
MIGHT
BE
FOUND
SOME
SALVATION
SPITE
OF

WHEN
I
FELT
A
SUDDEN

HORRIFIED
AT

THE
ADVOCATE
AS
QUEEQUEG
AND
I
ARE
NOW
FAIRLY
EMBARKED
IN
THIS
BUSINESS
OF
WHALING
AND
AS
THIS
BUSINESS
OF
WHALING
HAS
SOMEHOW
COME
TO
BE
REGARDED
AMONG
LANDSMEN
AS
A
RATHER
UNPOETICAL
AND
DISREPUTABLE

THEREFORE
I
AM
ALL

TO
CONVINCE

YE

OF
THE
INJUSTICE
HEREBY
DONE
TO
US
HUNTERS
OF
WHALES
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
IT
MAY
BE
DEEMED
ALMOST
SUPERFLUOUS
TO
ESTABLISH
THE
FACT
THAT
AMONG
PEOPLE
AT
LARGE
THE
BUSINESS
OF
WHALING
IS
NOT
ACCOUNTED
ON
A
LEVEL
WITH
WHAT
ARE
CALLED
THE
LIBERAL
PROFESSIONS
IF
A
STRANGER
WERE
INTRODUCED
INTO
ANY
MISCELLANEOUS
METROPOLITAN
SOCIETY
IT
WOULD
BUT
SLIGHTLY
ADVANCE
THE
GENERAL
OPINION
OF
HIS
MERITS
WERE
HE
PRESENTED
TO
THE
COMPANY
AS
A
HARPOONEER

AND
IF
IN

OF
THE
NAVAL
OFFICERS
HE
SHOULD
APPEND
THE
INITIALS
SWF
SPERM
WHALE
FISHERY
TO
HIS
VISITING
CARD
SUCH
A
PROCEDURE
WOULD
BE
DEEMED
PREEMINENTLY
PRESUMING
AND
RIDICULOUS
DOUBTLESS
ONE
LEADING
REASON
WHY
THE
WORLD
DECLINES
HONOURING
US
WHALEMEN
IS
THIS
THEY
THINK
THAT
AT
BEST
OUR
VOCATION
AMOUNTS
TO
A
BUTCHERING
SORT
OF

AND
THAT
WHEN
ACTIVELY
ENGAGED
THEREIN
WE
ARE
SURROUNDED
BY
ALL
MANNER
OF
DEFILEMENTS
BUTCHERS
WE
ARE
THAT
IS
TRUE
BUT
BUTCHERS
ALSO
AND
BUTCHERS
OF
THE
BLOODIEST
BADGE
HAVE
BEEN
ALL
MARTIAL
COMMANDERS
WHOM
THE
WORLD
INVARIABLY
DELIGHTS
TO
HONOUR
AND
AS
FOR
THE
MATTER
OF
THE
ALLEGED
UNCLEANLINESS
OF
OUR
BUSINESS
YE
SHALL
SOON
BE
INITIATED
INTO
CERTAIN
FACTS
HITHERTO
PRETTY
GENERALLY
UNKNOWN
AND
WHICH
UPON
THE
WHOLE
WILL
TRIUMPHANTLY
PLANT
THE
SPERM
WHALESHIP
AT
LEAST
AMONG
THE
CLEANLIEST
THINGS
OF
THIS
TIDY
EARTH
BUT
EVEN
GRANTING
THE
CHARGE
IN
QUESTION
TO
BE
TRUE
WHAT
DISORDERED
SLIPPERY
DECKS
OF
A
WHALESHIP
ARE
COMPARABLE
TO
THE
UNSPEAKABLE
CARRION
OF
THOSE
BATTLEFIELDS
FROM
WHICH
SO
MANY
SOLDIERS
RETURN
TO
DRINK
IN
ALL
LADIES
PLAUDITS
AND
IF
THE
IDEA
OF
PERIL
SO
MUCH
ENHANCES
THE
POPULAR
CONCEIT
OF
THE
SOLDIERS
PROFESSION
LET
ME
ASSURE
YE
THAT
MANY
A
VETERAN
WHO
HAS
FREELY
MARCHED
UP
TO
A
BATTERY
WOULD
QUICKLY
RECOIL
AT
THE
APPARITION
OF
THE
SPERM
WHALES
VAST
TAIL
FANNING
INTO

THE

OVER
HIS

FOR
WHAT
ARE
THE
COMPREHENSIBLE
TERRORS
OF
MAN
COMPARED
WITH
THE
INTERLINKED
TERRORS
AND
WONDERS
OF
GOD
BUT
THOUGH
THE
WORLD
SCOUTS
AT
US
WHALE
HUNTERS
YET
DOES
IT
UNWITTINGLY
PAY
US
THE
PROFOUNDEST
HOMAGE
YEA
AN
ALLABOUNDING
ADORATION
FOR
ALMOST
ALL
THE
TAPERS
LAMPS
AND
CANDLES
THAT
BURN
ROUND
THE
GLOBE
BURN
AS
BEFORE
SO
MANY
SHRINES
TO
OUR
GLORY
BUT
LOOK
AT
THIS
MATTER
IN
OTHER
LIGHTS
WEIGH
IT
IN
ALL
SORTS
OF
SCALES
SEE
WHAT
WE
WHALEMEN
ARE
AND
HAVE
BEEN
WHY
DID
THE
DUTCH
IN
DE
WITTS
TIME
HAVE
ADMIRALS
OF
THEIR
WHALING
FLEETS
WHY
DID
LOUIS
XVI
OF
FRANCE
AT
HIS
OWN
PERSONAL
EXPENSE
FIT
OUT
WHALING
SHIPS
FROM
DUNKIRK
AND
POLITELY
INVITE
TO
THAT
TOWN
SOME
SCORE
OR
TWO
OF
FAMILIES
FROM
OUR
OWN
ISLAND
OF
NANTUCKET
WHY
DID
BRITAIN
BETWEEN
THE
YEARS
1750
AND
1788
PAY
TO
HER
WHALEMEN
IN
BOUNTIES
UPWARDS
OF
L1000000
AND
LASTLY
HOW
COMES
IT
THAT
WE
WHALEMEN
OF
AMERICA
NOW
OUTNUMBER
ALL
THE
REST
OF
THE
BANDED
WHALEMEN
IN
THE

SAIL
A
NAVY

OF
SEVEN
HUNDRED

MANNED
BY
EIGHTEEN

CONSUMING
4000000
OF

THE
SHIPS
WORTH
AT
THE

OF

20000000
AND
EVERY

IMPORTING
INTO
OUR

A
WELL
REAPED
HARVEST
OF
7000000
HOW
COMES
ALL
THIS
IF
THERE
BE
NOT
SOMETHING
PUISSANT
IN
WHALING
BUT
THIS
IS
NOT
THE
HALF
LOOK
AGAIN
I
FREELY
ASSERT

AT

A

IN

A

IS

SEEMED
WELL

TO
ENDURE
HOT
LATITUDES
HIS

BEING
HARD
AS
TWICEBAKED

TRANSPORTED
TO
THE

HIS

WOULD
NOT

HE
MUST
HAVE
BEEN

IN

OR
UPON

OF
THOSE
FAST

FOR
WHICH
HIS

IS

ONLY
SOME
THIRTY
ARID
SUMMERS
HAD
HE
SEEN
THOSE
SUMMERS
HAD
DRIED
UP
ALL
HIS
PHYSICAL
SUPERFLUOUSNESS
BUT
THIS
HIS
THINNESS
SO
TO

SEEMED
NO

THE

OF

THAN
IT

CONFRONTED
THROUGH

CHAPTER
OF

YET
FOR
ALL
HIS
HARDY
SOBRIETY
AND

THERE
WERE
CERTAIN
QUALITIES
IN

WHICH
AT

AFFECTED
AND
IN
SOME

SEEMED
WELL
NIGH
TO
OVERBALANCE
ALL
THE

UNCOMMONLY
CONSCIENTIOUS
FOR
A

AND
ENDUED
WITH
A
DEEP
NATURAL
REVERENCE
THE
WILD
WATERY
LONELINESS
OF
HIS

DID
THEREFORE
STRONGLY
INCLINE
HIM
TO
SUPERSTITION
BUT
TO
THAT
SORT
OF
SUPERSTITION
WHICH
IN
SOME
ORGANIZATIONS
SEEMS
RATHER
TO
SPRING
SOMEHOW
FROM
INTELLIGENCE
THAN
FROM
IGNORANCE
OUTWARD
PORTENTS
AND
INWARD
PRESENTIMENTS
WERE
HIS
AND
IF
AT

THESE
THINGS
BENT
THE
WELDED
IRON
OF
HIS

MUCH
MORE
DID
HIS
FARAWAY
DOMESTIC
MEMORIES
OF
HIS
YOUNG
CAPE
WIFE
AND
CHILD
TEND
TO
BEND
HIM
STILL
MORE
FROM
THE
ORIGINAL
RUGGEDNESS
OF
HIS
NATURE
AND
OPEN
HIM
STILL
FURTHER
TO
THOSE
LATENT
INFLUENCES
WHICH
IN
SOME
HONESTHEARTED

RESTRAIN
THE
GUSH
OF

DARING
SO

IN
THE

PERILOUS
VICISSITUDES
OF

I
WILL
HAVE
NO
MAN
IN

SAID
STARBUCK
WHO
IS
NOT
AFRAID
OF
A
WHALE
BY
THIS
HE
SEEMED
TO
MEAN
NOT
ONLY
THAT
THE
MOST
RELIABLE
AND
USEFUL
COURAGE
WAS
THAT
WHICH
ARISES
FROM
THE
FAIR
ESTIMATION
OF
THE
ENCOUNTERED
PERIL
BUT
THAT
AN
UTTERLY
FEARLESS
MAN
IS
A
FAR
MORE
DANGEROUS
COMRADE
THAN
A

AYE
AYE

STUBB
THE

THERE
IS
AS
CAREFUL
A

AS
YOULL
FIND
ANYWHERE
IN

BUT
WE
SHALL
ERE

WHAT
THAT
WORD
CAREFUL
PRECISELY
MEANS
WHEN
USED
BY
A
MAN
LIKE

ALMOST
ANY
OTHER
WHALE
HUNTER
STARBUCK
WAS
NO
CRUSADER
AFTER
PERILS
IN
HIM

WAS
NOT

A
THING
SIMPLY
USEFUL
TO
HIM
AND
ALWAYS
AT

UPON
ALL
MORTALLY
PRACTICAL
OCCASIONS
BESIDES
HE
THOUGHT
PERHAPS
THAT
IN

OF

COURAGE
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
GREAT
STAPLE
OUTFITS
OF
THE

LIKE
HER

AND
HER

AND
NOT
TO
BE
FOOLISHLY
WASTED
WHEREFORE
HE
HAD
NO
FANCY
FOR
LOWERING
FOR
WHALES
AFTER

NOR
FOR
PERSISTING
IN

A

THAT
TOO

PERSISTED
IN

I
AM
HERE
IN

TO

FOR

AND
THAT
HUNDREDS
OF

HAD
BEEN
SO
KILLED
STARBUCK
WELL
KNEW
WHAT
DOOM
WAS
HIS
OWN
FATHERS
WHERE
IN
THE
BOTTOMLESS
DEEPS
COULD
HE
FIND
THE
TORN
LIMBS
OF
HIS

WITH

LIKE
THESE
IN
HIM
AND
MOREOVER
GIVEN
TO
A
CERTAIN
SUPERSTITIOUSNESS
AS
HAS
BEEN
SAID
THE
COURAGE
OF
THIS
STARBUCK
WHICH
COULD
NEVERTHELESS
STILL
FLOURISH
MUST
INDEED
HAVE
BEEN
EXTREME
BUT
IT
WAS
NOT
IN
REASONABLE
NATURE
THAT
A
MAN
SO
ORGANIZED
AND
WITH
SUCH
TERRIBLE
EXPERIENCES
AND
REMEMBRANCES
AS
HE
HAD
IT
WAS
NOT
IN
NATURE
THAT
THESE
THINGS
SHOULD
FAIL
IN
LATENTLY
ENGENDERING
AN
ELEMENT
IN
HIM
WHICH
UNDER
SUITABLE
CIRCUMSTANCES
WOULD
BREAK
OUT
FROM
ITS
CONFINEMENT
AND
BURN
ALL
HIS
COURAGE
UP
AND
BRAVE
AS
HE
MIGHT
BE
IT
WAS
THAT
SORT
OF
BRAVERY
CHIEFLY
VISIBLE
IN
SOME
INTREPID
MEN
WHICH
WHILE
GENERALLY
ABIDING

THE
CONFLICT
WITH

SOMETIMES

YOU
FROM

THAT
OVER

NEITHER

OF

TOILING

GOODHUMORED
EASY

HE
PRESIDED
OVER
HIS
WHALEBOAT
AS
IF
THE
MOST
DEADLY
ENCOUNTER
WERE
BUT
A
DINNER
AND
HIS
CREW
ALL
INVITED
GUESTS
HE
WAS
AS

ABOUT
THE

ARRANGEMENT
OF
HIS
PART
OF
THE

AS
AN

STAGEDRIVER
IS
ABOUT
THE
SNUGNESS
OF

WHEN
CLOSE
TO
THE

IN
THE
VERY
DEATHLOCK
OF
THE

HE
HANDLED
HIS
UNPITYING

COOLLY

OFFHANDEDLY
AS
A
WHISTLING
TINKER
HIS

HE

WHILE

WITH
THE

EXASPERATED
MONSTER
LONG
USAGE
HAD
FOR
THIS
STUBB
CONVERTED
THE
JAWS
OF
DEATH
INTO
AN

WHAT
HE
THOUGHT
OF
DEATH
ITSELF
THERE
IS
NO
TELLING
WHETHER
HE
EVER
THOUGHT
OF
IT
AT
ALL
MIGHT
BE
A
QUESTION
BUT
IF
HE
EVER
DID
CHANCE
TO
CAST
HIS
MIND
THAT
WAY
AFTER
A
COMFORTABLE
DINNER
NO
DOUBT
LIKE
A
GOOD
SAILOR
HE
TOOK
IT
TO
BE
A
SORT
OF
CALL
OF
THE
WATCH
TO
TUMBLE
ALOFT
AND
BESTIR
THEMSELVES
THERE
ABOUT
SOMETHING
WHICH
HE
WOULD
FIND
OUT
WHEN
HE
OBEYED
THE

AND
NOT
SOONER
WHAT
PERHAPS
WITH
OTHER

MADE
STUBB
SUCH
AN
EASYGOING
UNFEARING
MAN
SO
CHEERILY
TRUDGING
OFF
WITH
THE
BURDEN
OF

IN
A
WORLD
FULL
OF
GRAVE
PEDLARS
ALL
BOWED
TO
THE
GROUND
WITH
THEIR

WHAT
HELPED
TO
BRING
ABOUT
THAT
ALMOST
IMPIOUS
GOODHUMOR
OF
HIS
THAT
THING
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
HIS
PIPE
FOR
LIKE
HIS
NOSE
HIS
SHORT
BLACK
LITTLE
PIPE
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
REGULAR
FEATURES
OF
HIS
FACE
YOU
WOULD
ALMOST
AS
SOON
HAVE
EXPECTED
HIM
TO
TURN
OUT
OF
HIS
BUNK
WITHOUT
HIS
NOSE
AS
WITHOUT
HIS
PIPE
HE
KEPT
A
WHOLE

OF

THERE
READY
LOADED
STUCK
IN
A
RACK
WITHIN
EASY
REACH
OF
HIS
HAND
AND
WHENEVER
HE
TURNED
IN
HE
SMOKED
THEM
ALL
OUT
IN
SUCCESSION
LIGHTING
ONE
FROM
THE
OTHER
TO
THE

OF

THEN
LOADING

ANEW
FOR
WHEN
STUBB
DRESSED
INSTEAD
OF
FIRST
PUTTING
HIS
LEGS
INTO
HIS
TROWSERS
HE
PUT
HIS
PIPE
INTO
HIS
MOUTH
I
SAY
THIS
CONTINUAL
SMOKING
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
ONE
CAUSE
AT

OF
HIS
PECULIAR
DISPOSITION
FOR
EVERY
ONE
KNOWS
THAT
THIS
EARTHLY
AIR
WHETHER
ASHORE
OR
AFLOAT
IS
TERRIBLY
INFECTED
WITH
THE
NAMELESS
MISERIES
OF
THE
NUMBERLESS

SO

THE
THIRD

WAS
FLASK
A
NATIVE
OF
TISBURY
IN
MARTHAS
VINEYARD
A
SHORT
STOUT
RUDDY
YOUNG
FELLOW
VERY
PUGNACIOUS
CONCERNING
WHALES
WHO
SOMEHOW
SEEMED
TO
THINK
THAT
THE
GREAT
LEVIATHANS
HAD
PERSONALLY
AND
HEREDITARILY
AFFRONTED
HIM
AND
THEREFORE
IT
WAS
A
SORT
OF
POINT
OF
HONOUR
WITH
HIM
TO
DESTROY
THEM
WHENEVER
ENCOUNTERED
SO
UTTERLY
LOST
WAS
HE
TO
ALL
SENSE
OF
REVERENCE
FOR
THE
MANY
MARVELS
OF
THEIR
MAJESTIC
BULK
AND
MYSTIC
WAYS
AND
SO
DEAD
TO
ANYTHING
LIKE
AN
APPREHENSION
OF
ANY
POSSIBLE
DANGER
FROM
ENCOUNTERING
THEM
THAT
IN
HIS
POOR
OPINION
THE
WONDROUS
WHALE
WAS
BUT
A
SPECIES
OF
MAGNIFIED
MOUSE
OR
AT

WATERRAT
REQUIRING
ONLY
A
LITTLE
CIRCUMVENTION
AND
SOME
SMALL
APPLICATION
OF
TIME
AND
TROUBLE
IN

TO
KILL
AND

THIS
IGNORANT
UNCONSCIOUS
FEARLESSNESS
OF

HIM
A
LITTLE
WAGGISH
IN

OF

HE
FOLLOWED
THESE
FISH
FOR
THE
FUN
OF
IT
AND
A

WAS
ONLY
A
JOLLY

INTO
WROUGHT

MADE

TIGHT
AND
LAST
LONG
THEY
CALLED
HIM

ON

OF

IN

HE
COULD
BE
WELL
LIKENED
TO
THE
SHORT
SQUARE

KNOWN
BY

IN

WHALERS

WHICH
BY
THE

IN

THEY
WERE

SINCE
IN

ALWAYS
ACCOMPANIED
BY

SENIOR
AN

AMONG

SUPERSTITIOUSLY
ASSERTED
THAT
NOT
TILL
HE
WAS
FULL
FORTY
YEARS

DID
AHAB
BECOME

AND
THEN
IT
CAME
UPON
HIM
NOT
IN

OF

IN
AN

STRIFE
AT

THIS

SEEMED
INFERENTIALLY
NEGATIVED
BY

A

INSINUATED
AN

HAD

NEVERTHELESS
THE

THE
IMMEMORIAL
CREDULITIES
POPULARLY
INVESTED
THIS

WITH
PRETERNATURAL
POWERS
OF

SO
THAT
NO
WHITE
SAILOR
SERIOUSLY
CONTRADICTED
HIM
WHEN
HE
SAID
THAT
IF

SHOULD
BE
TRANQUILLY

OUTWHICH
MIGHT
HARDLY
COME
TO

SO
HE
MUTTEREDTHEN
WHOEVER
SHOULD

THAT
LAST

FOR

WOULD
FIND
A

ON

FROM
CROWN
TO

SO
POWERFULLY
DID
THE
WHOLE
GRIM
ASPECT
OF
AHAB
AFFECT
ME
AND
THE
LIVID
BRAND
WHICH
STREAKED
IT
THAT
FOR
THE
FIRST
FEW
MOMENTS
I
HARDLY
NOTED
THAT
NOT
A
LITTLE
OF
THIS
OVERBEARING
GRIMNESS
WAS
OWING
TO
THE
BARBARIC
WHITE
LEG
UPON
WHICH
HE
PARTLY
STOOD
IT
HAD
PREVIOUSLY
COME
TO
ME
THAT
THIS
IVORY
LEG
HAD
AT

BEEN
FASHIONED
FROM
THE
POLISHED
BONE
OF
THE
SPERM
WHALES
JAW
AYE
HE
WAS
DISMASTED
OFF
JAPAN
SAID
THE
OLD
GAYHEAD
INDIAN
ONCE
BUT
LIKE
HIS
DISMASTED
CRAFT
HE
SHIPPED
ANOTHER
MAST
WITHOUT
COMING
HOME
FOR
IT
HE
HAS
A
QUIVER
OF
EM
I
WAS
STRUCK
WITH
THE
SINGULAR
POSTURE
HE
MAINTAINED
UPON
EACH
SIDE
OF
THE
PEQUODS
QUARTER
DECK
AND
PRETTY
CLOSE
TO
THE
MIZZEN
SHROUDS
THERE
WAS
AN
AUGER
HOLE
BORED
ABOUT
HALF
AN
INCH
OR
SO
INTO
THE
PLANK
HIS
BONE
LEG
STEADIED
IN
THAT
HOLE
ONE
ARM
ELEVATED
AND
HOLDING
BY
A
SHROUD
CAPTAIN
AHAB
STOOD
ERECT
LOOKING
STRAIGHT
OUT
BEYOND
THE
SHIPS
EVERPITCHING
PROW
THERE
WAS
AN
INFINITY
OF
FIRMEST
FORTITUDE
A
DETERMINATE
UNSURRENDERABLE
WILFULNESS
IN
THE
FIXED
AND
FEARLESS
FORWARD
DEDICATION
OF
THAT
GLANCE
NOT
A
WORD
HE
SPOKE
NOR
DID
HIS
OFFICERS
SAY
AUGHT
TO
HIM
THOUGH
BY
ALL
THEIR
MINUTEST
GESTURES
AND
EXPRESSIONS
THEY
PLAINLY
SHOWED
THE
UNEASY
IF
NOT
PAINFUL
CONSCIOUSNESS
OF
BEING
UNDER
A
TROUBLED
MASTEREYE
AND
NOT
ONLY
THAT
BUT
MOODY
STRICKEN
AHAB
STOOD
BEFORE
THEM
WITH
A
CRUCIFIXION
IN
HIS
FACE
IN
ALL
THE
NAMELESS
REGAL
OVERBEARING
DIGNITY
OF
SOME
MIGHTY
WOE
ERE
LONG
FROM
HIS
FIRST
VISIT
IN
THE
AIR
HE
WITHDREW
INTO
HIS
CABIN
BUT
AFTER
THAT
MORNING
HE
WAS
EVERY
DAY
VISIBLE
TO
THE
CREW
EITHER
STANDING
IN
HIS
PIVOTHOLE
OR
SEATED
UPON
AN
IVORY
STOOL
HE
HAD
OR
HEAVILY
WALKING
THE
DECK
AS
THE
SKY
GREW
LESS
GLOOMY
INDEED
BEGAN
TO
GROW
A
LITTLE
GENIAL
HE
BECAME
STILL
LESS
AND
LESS
A
RECLUSE
AS
IF
WHEN
THE
SHIP
HAD
SAILED
FROM
HOME
NOTHING
BUT
THE
DEAD
WINTRY
BLEAKNESS
OF
THE
SEA
HAD
THEN
KEPT
HIM
SO
SECLUDED
AND
BY
AND
BY
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
THAT
HE
WAS
ALMOST
CONTINUALLY
IN
THE
AIR
BUT
AS
YET
FOR
ALL
THAT
HE
SAID
OR
PERCEPTIBLY
DID
ON
THE
AT
LAST
SUNNY
DECK
HE
SEEMED
AS
UNNECESSARY
THERE
AS
ANOTHER
MAST
BUT
THE
PEQUOD
WAS
ONLY
MAKING
A
PASSAGE
NOW
NOT
REGULARLY
CRUISING
NEARLY
ALL
WHALING
PREPARATIVES
NEEDING
SUPERVISION
THE
MATES
WERE
FULLY
COMPETENT
TO
SO
THAT
THERE
WAS
LITTLE
OR
NOTHING
OUT
OF
HIMSELF
TO
EMPLOY
OR
EXCITE
AHAB
NOW
AND
THUS
CHASE
AWAY
FOR
THAT
ONE
INTERVAL
THE
CLOUDS
THAT
LAYER
UPON
LAYER
WERE
PILED
UPON
HIS
BROW
AS
EVER
ALL

CHOOSE
THE
LOFTIEST
PEAKS
TO
PILE
THEMSELVES
UPON
NEVERTHELESS
ERE
LONG
THE
WARM
WARBLING
PERSUASIVENESS
OF
THE
PLEASANT
HOLIDAY
WEATHER
WE
CAME
TO
SEEMED
GRADUALLY
TO
CHARM
HIM
FROM
HIS

FOR

WHEN

WILL
AT

SEND
FORTH
SOME

GREEN
SPROUTS
TO
WELCOME
SUCH

SO
AHAB
DID
IN
THE
END
A
LITTLE
RESPOND
TO
THE
PLAYFUL
ALLURINGS
OF
THAT
GIRLISH
AIR
MORE
THAN
ONCE
DID
HE
PUT
FORTH
THE
FAINT
BLOSSOM
OF
A
LOOK
WHICH
IN
ANY
OTHER
MAN
WOULD
HAVE
SOON
FLOWERED
OUT
IN

THE

NOW
WENT
ROLLING
THROUGH
THE

AT

ALMOST
PERPETUALLY
REIGNS
ON
THE
THRESHOLD
OF
THE
ETERNAL
AUGUST
OF
THE
TROPIC
THE
WARMLY
COOL
CLEAR
RINGING
PERFUMED
OVERFLOWING
REDUNDANT

WERE
AS

STATELY

THE

INWARD
THEY

UPON
THE

ESPECIALLY
WHEN
THE

WITH

THAT
LOOKS
LIKE
DEATH
AMONG

THE

GREYBEARDS
WILL
OFTENEST
LEAVE
THEIR
BERTHS
TO
VISIT
THE
NIGHTCLOAKED
DECK
IT
WAS
SO
WITH
AHAB
ONLY
THAT
NOW
OF
LATE
HE
SEEMED
SO
MUCH
TO
LIVE
IN
THE
OPEN
AIR
THAT
TRULY
SPEAKING
HIS
VISITS
WERE
MORE
TO
THE
CABIN
THAN
FROM
THE

TO
THE

IT
FEELS
LIKE
GOING
DOWN
INTO

TOMBHE
WOULD
MUTTER
TO

AN

LIKE

TO
BE
DESCENDING
THIS
NARROW

TO
GO
TO
MY

SO
ALMOST
EVERY
TWENTYFOUR

WHEN
THE
WATCHES
OF
THE
NIGHT
WERE
SET
AND
THE

ON

SENTINELLED
THE
SLUMBERS
OF
THE

AND
WHEN
IF
A
ROPE
WAS
TO
BE
HAULED
UPON
THE
FORECASTLE
THE
SAILORS
FLUNG
IT
NOT
RUDELY
DOWN
AS
BY
DAY
BUT
WITH
SOME
CAUTIOUSNESS
DROPT
IT
TO
ITS
PLACE
FOR
FEAR
OF
DISTURBING
THEIR
SLUMBERING
SHIPMATES
WHEN
THIS
SORT
OF
STEADY
QUIETUDE
WOULD
BEGIN
TO
PREVAIL
HABITUALLY
THE
SILENT
STEERSMAN
WOULD
WATCH
THE
CABINSCUTTLE
AND
ERE
LONG
THE
OLD
MAN
WOULD
EMERGE
GRIPPING
AT
THE
IRON
BANISTER
TO
HELP
HIS
CRIPPLED
WAY
SOME
CONSIDERING
TOUCH
OF
HUMANITY
WAS
IN
HIM
FOR
AT
TIMES
LIKE
THESE
HE
USUALLY
ABSTAINED
FROM
PATROLLING
THE
QUARTERDECK
BECAUSE
TO
HIS
WEARIED
MATES
SEEKING
REPOSE
WITHIN
SIX
INCHES
OF
HIS
IVORY
HEEL
SUCH
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
THE
REVERBERATING
CRACK
AND
DIN
OF
THAT
BONY
STEP
THAT
THEIR
DREAMS
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
ON
THE
CRUNCHING
TEETH
OF
SHARKS
BUT
ONCE
THE
MOOD
WAS
ON
HIM
TOO
DEEP
FOR
COMMON
REGARDINGS
AND
AS
WITH
HEAVY
LUMBERLIKE
PACE
HE
WAS
MEASURING
THE
SHIP
FROM
TAFFRAIL
TO
MAINMAST
STUBB
THE
OLD
SECOND
MATE
CAME
UP
FROM
BELOW
WITH
A
CERTAIN
UNASSURED
DEPRECATING
HUMOROUSNESS
HINTED
THAT
IF
CAPTAIN
AHAB
WAS
PLEASED
TO
WALK
THE
PLANKS
THEN
NO
ONE
COULD
SAY
NAY
BUT
THERE
MIGHT
BE
SOME
WAY
OF
MUFFLING
THE
NOISE
HINTING
SOMETHING
INDISTINCTLY
AND
HESITATINGLY
ABOUT
A
GLOBE
OF
TOW
AND
THE
INSERTION
INTO
IT
OF
THE
IVORY
HEEL
AH
STUBB
THOU
DIDST
NOT
KNOW
AHAB
THEN
AM
I
A

SAID
AHAB
THAT
THOU
WOULDST
WAD

BUT
GO

I
HAD
FORGOT
BELOW

CONCLUDING
EXCLAMATION
OF

SUDDENLY
SCORNFUL

WAS
SPEECHLESS
A

THEN
SAID
EXCITEDLY
I
AM
NOT
USED
TO
BE
SPOKEN
TO
THAT
WAY
SIR
I
DO
BUT
LESS
THAN
HALF
LIKE
IT
SIR
AVAST
GRITTED
AHAB
BETWEEN
HIS

AND
VIOLENTLY
MOVING
AWAY
AS
IF
TO

SOME
PASSIONATE
TEMPTATION
NO

WAS
NEVER

WITHOUT
GIVING
A

HERE
ON
MY
KNEES
AND
PRAY
FOR

YES
THAT
WAS
THE
THOUGHT
COMING
UP
IN

HE
MAD
ANYWAY
THERES
SOMETHING
ON
HIS
MIND
AS
SURE
AS
THERE
MUST
BE
SOMETHING
ON
A
DECK
WHEN
IT
CRACKS
HE
AINT
IN
HIS
BED
NOW
EITHER
MORE
THAN
THREE
HOURS
OUT
OF
THE
TWENTYFOUR
AND
HE
DONT

THEN
DIDNT
THAT
DOUGHBOY

OF
A
MORNING
HE
ALWAYS
FINDS
THE

BUT
ALL

JACKASSES
ON

OF
THAT
HE
MIGHT
AS
WELL
HAVE
KICKED
ME
AND
DONE
WITH
IT
MAYBE
HE
DID
KICK
ME
AND
I
DIDNT
OBSERVE
IT
I
WAS
SO
TAKEN
ALL
ABACK
WITH
HIS

FLASHED
LIKE

BLEACHED
BONE
WHAT

THEN
AS
HAD

MY

IS

TO

THE

OF

I
AM
THE

NOT
THE

BUT
IT
IS
A
PONDEROUS
TASK
NO

LETTERSORTER
IN

IS

TO
IT
TO

AMONG

BEHOLD
THE

OF
HIM
IS
VAIN
BUT
I
HAVE
SWAM
THROUGH

AND
SAILED
THROUGH

I
HAVE
HAD
TO
DO
WITH
WHALES
WITH
THESE
VISIBLE
HANDS
I
AM
IN

AND
I
WILL
TRY
THERE
ARE
SOME
PRELIMINARIES
TO
SETTLE
FIRST
THE
UNCERTAIN
UNSETTLED
CONDITION
OF
THIS
SCIENCE
OF
CETOLOGY
IS
IN
THE
VERY
VESTIBULE
ATTESTED
BY
THE
FACT
THAT
IN
SOME
QUARTERS
IT
STILL
REMAINS
A
MOOT
POINT
WHETHER
A
WHALE
BE
A
FISH
IN
HIS
SYSTEM
OF
NATURE
AD
1776
LINNAEUS
DECLARES
I
HEREBY
SEPARATE
THE
WHALES
FROM
THE
FISH
BUT
OF
MY
OWN
KNOWLEDGE
I
KNOW
THAT
DOWN
TO
THE
YEAR
1850
SHARKS
AND
SHAD
ALEWIVES
AND
HERRING
AGAINST
LINNAEUSS
EXPRESS
EDICT
WERE
STILL
FOUND
DIVIDING
THE
POSSESSION
OF
THE
SAME
SEAS
WITH
THE
LEVIATHAN
THE
GROUNDS
UPON
WHICH
LINNAEUS
WOULD
FAIN
HAVE
BANISHED
THE
WHALES
FROM
THE
WATERS
HE
STATES
AS
FOLLOWS
ON
ACCOUNT
OF
THEIR
WARM
BILOCULAR
HEART
THEIR
LUNGS
THEIR
MOVABLE
EYELIDS
THEIR
HOLLOW
EARS
PENEM
INTRANTEM
FEMINAM
MAMMIS
LACTANTEM
AND
FINALLY
EX
LEGE
NATURAE
JURE
MERITOQUE
I
SUBMITTED
ALL
THIS
TO
MY
FRIENDS
SIMEON
MACEY
AND
CHARLEY
COFFIN
OF
NANTUCKET
BOTH
MESSMATES
OF
MINE
IN
A
CERTAIN
VOYAGE
AND
THEY
UNITED
IN
THE
OPINION
THAT
THE
REASONS
SET
FORTH
WERE
ALTOGETHER
INSUFFICIENT
CHARLEY
PROFANELY
HINTED
THEY
WERE
HUMBUG
BE
IT
KNOWN
THAT
WAIVING
ALL
ARGUMENT
I
TAKE
THE
GOOD
OLD
FASHIONED
GROUND
THAT
THE
WHALE
IS
A
FISH
AND
CALL
UPON
HOLY
JONAH
TO
BACK
ME
THIS
FUNDAMENTAL
THING
SETTLED
THE
NEXT
POINT
IS
IN
WHAT
INTERNAL
RESPECT
DOES
THE
WHALE
DIFFER
FROM
OTHER
FISH
ABOVE
LINNAEUS
HAS
GIVEN
YOU
THOSE
ITEMS
BUT
IN
BRIEF
THEY
ARE
THESE
LUNGS
AND
WARM
BLOOD
WHEREAS
ALL
OTHER
FISH
ARE
LUNGLESS
AND
COLD
BLOODED
NEXT
HOW
SHALL
WE
DEFINE
THE
WHALE
BY
HIS
OBVIOUS
EXTERNALS
SO
AS
CONSPICUOUSLY
TO
LABEL
HIM
FOR
ALL
TIME
TO
COME
TO
BE
SHORT
THEN
A
WHALE
IS
A
SPOUTING
FISH
WITH
A
HORIZONTAL
TAIL
THERE
YOU
HAVE
HIM
HOWEVER
CONTRACTED
THAT
DEFINITION
IS
THE
RESULT
OF
EXPANDED
MEDITATION
A
WALRUS
SPOUTS
MUCH
LIKE
A
WHALE
BUT
THE
WALRUS
IS
NOT
A
FISH
BECAUSE
HE
IS
AMPHIBIOUS
BUT
THE
LAST
TERM
OF
THE
DEFINITION
IS
STILL
MORE
COGENT
AS
COUPLED
WITH
THE
FIRST
ALMOST
ANY
ONE
MUST
HAVE
NOTICED
THAT
ALL
THE
FISH
FAMILIAR
TO
LANDSMEN
HAVE
NOT
A
FLAT
BUT
A
VERTICAL
OR
UPANDDOWN
TAIL
WHEREAS
AMONG
SPOUTING
FISH
THE
TAIL
THOUGH
IT
MAY
BE
SIMILARLY
SHAPED
INVARIABLY
ASSUMES
A
HORIZONTAL
POSITION
BY
THE
ABOVE
DEFINITION
OF
WHAT
A
WHALE
IS
I
DO
BY
NO
MEANS
EXCLUDE
FROM
THE
LEVIATHANIC
BROTHERHOOD
ANY
SEA
CREATURE
HITHERTO
IDENTIFIED
WITH
THE
WHALE
BY
THE
BEST
INFORMED
NANTUCKETERS
NOR
ON
THE
OTHER

WITH
IT
ANY
FISH
HITHERTO
AUTHORITATIVELY
REGARDED
AS
ALIEN
HENCE
ALL
THE
SMALLER
SPOUTING
AND
HORIZONTAL
TAILED
FISH
MUST
BE
INCLUDED
IN
THIS
GROUNDPLAN
OF

NOW
THEN
COME
THE
GRAND
DIVISIONS
OF
THE
ENTIRE
WHALE
HOST
I
AM
AWARE
THAT
DOWN
TO
THE
PRESENT

THE
FISH
STYLED
LAMATINS
AND
DUGONGS
PIGFISH
AND
SOWFISH
OF
THE
COFFINS
OF

ARE
INCLUDED
BY
MANY
NATURALISTS
AMONG
THE
WHALES
BUT
AS
THESE
PIGFISH
ARE
A
NOISY
CONTEMPTIBLE
SET
MOSTLY
LURKING
IN
THE
MOUTHS
OF
RIVERS
AND
FEEDING
ON

AND
ESPECIALLY
AS
THEY
DO
NOT

I
DENY
THEIR
CREDENTIALS
AS

AND
HAVE
PRESENTED
THEM
WITH
THEIR

TO

OF

ACCORDING

THE

HAVE
HE
HAS
A

HIS

THOUGH
HIS

THE
SPECKSYNDER
CONCERNING
THE
OFFICERS
OF
THE
WHALECRAFT
THIS
SEEMS
AS
GOOD
A
PLACE
AS
ANY
TO
SET
DOWN
A
LITTLE
DOMESTIC
PECULIARITY
ON
SHIPBOARD
ARISING
FROM
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
THE
HARPOONEER
CLASS
OF
OFFICERS
A
CLASS
UNKNOWN
OF
COURSE
IN
ANY
OTHER
MARINE
THAN
THE
WHALEFLEET
THE
LARGE
IMPORTANCE
ATTACHED
TO
THE
HARPOONEERS
VOCATION
IS
EVINCED
BY
THE
FACT
THAT
ORIGINALLY
IN
THE
OLD
DUTCH
FISHERY
TWO
CENTURIES
AND
MORE
AGO
THE
COMMAND
OF
A
WHALE
SHIP
WAS
NOT
WHOLLY
LODGED
IN
THE
PERSON
NOW
CALLED
THE
CAPTAIN
BUT
WAS
DIVIDED
BETWEEN
HIM
AND
AN
OFFICER
CALLED
THE
SPECKSYNDER
LITERALLY
THIS
WORD
MEANS
FATCUTTER
USAGE
HOWEVER
IN
TIME
MADE
IT
EQUIVALENT
TO
CHIEF
HARPOONEER
IN
THOSE
DAYS
THE
CAPTAINS
AUTHORITY
WAS
RESTRICTED
TO
THE
NAVIGATION
AND
GENERAL
MANAGEMENT
OF
THE
VESSEL
WHILE
OVER
THE
WHALEHUNTING
DEPARTMENT
AND
ALL
ITS
CONCERNS
THE
SPECKSYNDER
OR
CHIEF
HARPOONEER
REIGNED
SUPREME
IN
THE
BRITISH
GREENLAND
FISHERY
UNDER
THE
CORRUPTED
TITLE
OF
SPECKSIONEER
THIS
OLD
DUTCH
OFFICIAL
IS
STILL
RETAINED
BUT
HIS
FORMER
DIGNITY
IS
SADLY
ABRIDGED
AT
PRESENT
HE
RANKS
SIMPLY
AS
SENIOR
HARPOONEER
AND
AS
SUCH
IS
BUT
ONE
OF
THE
CAPTAINS
MORE
INFERIOR
SUBALTERNS
NEVERTHELESS
AS
UPON
THE
GOOD
CONDUCT
OF
THE
HARPOONEERS
THE
SUCCESS
OF
A
WHALING
VOYAGE
LARGELY
DEPENDS
AND
SINCE
IN
THE
AMERICAN
FISHERY
HE
IS
NOT
ONLY
AN
IMPORTANT
OFFICER
IN
THE
BOAT
BUT
UNDER
CERTAIN
CIRCUMSTANCES
NIGHT
WATCHES
ON
A
WHALING
GROUND
THE
COMMAND
OF
THE
SHIPS
DECK
IS
ALSO
HIS
THEREFORE
THE
GRAND
POLITICAL
MAXIM
OF
THE
SEA
DEMANDS
THAT
HE
SHOULD
NOMINALLY
LIVE
APART
FROM
THE
MEN
BEFORE
THE
MAST
AND
BE
IN
SOME
WAY
DISTINGUISHED
AS
THEIR
PROFESSIONAL
SUPERIOR
THOUGH
ALWAYS
BY
THEM
FAMILIARLY
REGARDED
AS
THEIR
SOCIAL
EQUAL
NOW
THE
GRAND
DISTINCTION
DRAWN
BETWEEN
OFFICER
AND
MAN
AT

IS
THISTHE
FIRST
LIVES
AFT
THE
LAST
FORWARD
HENCE
IN
WHALESHIPS
AND
MERCHANTMEN
ALIKE
THE
MATES
HAVE
THEIR
QUARTERS
WITH
THE
CAPTAIN
AND
SO
TOO
IN
MOST
OF
THE
AMERICAN
WHALERS
THE
HARPOONEERS
ARE
LODGED
IN
THE
AFTER
PART
OF
THE
SHIP
THAT
IS
TO
SAY
THEY
TAKE
THEIR
MEALS
IN
THE
CAPTAINS
CABIN
AND
SLEEP
IN
A

INDIRECTLY
COMMUNICATING
WITH
IT

THE

THE

OF

HIGH

FOR

NOT
UPON

BUT
UPON
THEIR
COMMON
LUCK
TOGETHER
WITH
THEIR

VIGILANCE
INTREPIDITY
AND
HARD
WORK
THOUGH
ALL
THESE
THINGS
DO
IN
SOME
CASES
TEND
TO
BEGET
A
LESS
RIGOROUS
DISCIPLINE
THAN
IN

GENERALLY
YET
NEVER

HOW
MUCH
LIKE
AN

MESOPOTAMIAN
FAMILY
THESE
WHALEMEN
MAY
IN
SOME
PRIMITIVE

LIVE
TOGETHER
FOR
ALL
THAT
THE
PUNCTILIOUS
EXTERNALS
AT

OF

ARE
SELDOM
MATERIALLY
RELAXED

IN

YOU
WILL

THE

OF

WAS
THE

TO
THAT

OF
SHALLOWEST
ASSUMPTION

THOUGH
THE

WAS
IMPLICIT

THE

HE

NOR

WILL
IT
FAIL
TO

INCIDENTALLY
MAKING

FOR

WERE
LEGITIMATELY

IN

REMAINED

ON

THAT
MOODY

HAD
NOT

HIS

BUT
PRESENTLY
CATCHING
HOLD
OF
THE
MIZEN
SHROUDS
HE
SWINGS
HIMSELF
TO
THE

AND
IN
AN
EVEN
UNEXHILARATED
VOICE
SAYING
DINNER
MR
STARBUCK
DISAPPEARS
INTO
THE

WHEN
THE
LAST
ECHO
OF

STEP
HAS
DIED
AWAY
AND

EVERY

TAKES
A

ALONG

INTO

SAYS

HE
LIKEWISE
TAKES

WITH
A

FOLLOWS
AFTER
HIS
PREDECESSORS
BUT
THE
THIRD
EMIR
NOW
SEEING
HIMSELF
ALL
ALONE
ON
THE
QUARTERDECK
SEEMS
TO
FEEL
RELIEVED
FROM
SOME
CURIOUS
RESTRAINT
FOR
TIPPING
ALL
SORTS
OF
KNOWING
WINKS
IN
ALL
SORTS
OF
DIRECTIONS
AND
KICKING
OFF
HIS

HE
STRIKES
INTO
A
SHARP

NOISELESS
SQUALL
OF
A
HORNPIPE
RIGHT
OVER
THE

HEAD
AND
THEN
BY
A
DEXTEROUS
SLEIGHT
PITCHING
HIS

UP
INTO
THE

FOR

HE
GOES
DOWN
ROLLICKING

REMAINS

FROM

REVERSING

IT
IS
NOT

AMONG

BRED
BY
THE

ARTIFICIALNESS
OF

THAT

SOME

THIS
IS
MARVELLOUS
SOMETIMES

COMICAL
WHEREFORE
THIS

A

PERHAPS
NOT

KING

AND
TO

NOT
HAUGHTILY

COURTEOUSLY
THEREIN
CERTAINLY
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
SOME

IT
IS
A

WHICH
THERE
IS
NO

NOW
IF
TO
THIS

YOU
SUPERADD
THE

OF

THEN
BY

YOU
WILL
DERIVE
THE

OF
THAT
PECULIARITY
OF

JUST
MENTIONED

IN

EACH

WAITED

THEY
WERE

SEEMED

I
DO
NOT

THEY

WITH

EVEN

WHERE
THE

NEVERTHELESS

THE

DENIED

WHETHER
HE
DEEMED

HAPPENS
TO

A

HIMSELF
HE

THAT

FOR
IT
IS
AGAINST
HOLY

FOR

STILL

IN

THAT

THE

NOW
AS
THE

ASHORE

IS
A
VERY
ANCIENT
AND
INTERESTING
ONE
LET
US
IN
SOME
MEASURE
EXPATIATE
HERE
I
TAKE
IT
THAT
THE
EARLIEST
STANDERS
OF
MASTHEADS
WERE
THE
OLD
EGYPTIANS
BECAUSE
IN
ALL
MY
RESEARCHES
I
FIND
NONE
PRIOR
TO
THEM
FOR
THOUGH
THEIR
PROGENITORS
THE
BUILDERS
OF
BABEL
MUST
DOUBTLESS
BY
THEIR
TOWER
HAVE
INTENDED
TO
REAR
THE
LOFTIEST
MASTHEAD
IN
ALL
ASIA
OR
AFRICA
EITHER
YET
ERE
THE
FINAL
TRUCK
WAS
PUT
TO
IT
AS
THAT
GREAT
STONE
MAST
OF
THEIRS
MAY
BE
SAID
TO
HAVE
GONE
BY
THE
BOARD
IN
THE
DREAD
GALE
OF
GODS
WRATH
THEREFORE
WE
CANNOT
GIVE
THESE
BABEL
BUILDERS
PRIORITY
OVER
THE
EGYPTIANS
AND
THAT
THE
EGYPTIANS
WERE
A
NATION
OF
MASTHEAD
STANDERS
IS
AN
ASSERTION
BASED
UPON
THE
GENERAL
BELIEF
AMONG
ARCHAEOLOGISTS
THAT
THE
FIRST
PYRAMIDS
WERE
FOUNDED
FOR
ASTRONOMICAL
PURPOSES
A
THEORY
SINGULARLY
SUPPORTED
BY
THE
PECULIAR
STAIRLIKE

FOUR

WHEREBY
WITH

WERE

IT

THERE
YOU
STAND
A

AS

EVEN
AS

THERE
YOU

THE

ALL

AND

ARE

YOUR

IS
IMMUTABLE
IN

OF

ON
A

THREE

AS
OFTEN
HAPPENS
THE
SUM
OF
THE
VARIOUS

YOU
SPEND
AT
THE

WOULD
AMOUNT
TO
SEVERAL
ENTIRE
MONTHS
AND
IT
IS
MUCH
TO
BE
DEPLORED
THAT
THE
PLACE
TO
WHICH
YOU
DEVOTE
SO
CONSIDERABLE
A
PORTION
OF
THE
WHOLE
TERM
OF
YOUR

SHOULD
BE
SO
SADLY
DESTITUTE
OF

APPROACHING
TO
A
COSY
INHABITIVENESS
OR
ADAPTED
TO

A

LOCALNESS
OF

SUCH
AS
PERTAINS
TO

A

A

A

A

OR
ANY
OTHER
OF
THOSE
SMALL
AND
SNUG
CONTRIVANCES
IN
WHICH
MEN
TEMPORARILY
ISOLATE
THEMSELVES
YOUR
MOST
USUAL
POINT
OF
PERCH
IS
THE
HEAD
OF
THE
T
GALLANTMAST
WHERE
YOU
STAND
UPON
TWO
THIN
PARALLEL
STICKS
ALMOST
PECULIAR
TO
WHALEMEN
CALLED
THE
T
GALLANT
CROSSTREES
HERE
TOSSED
ABOUT
BY
THE

THE
BEGINNER
FEELS
ABOUT
AS
COSY
AS
HE
WOULD
STANDING
ON

TO
BE
SURE
IN
COLD
WEATHER
YOU
MAY
CARRY
YOUR
HOUSE
ALOFT
WITH
YOU
IN
THE
SHAPE
OF
A
WATCHCOAT
BUT
PROPERLY
SPEAKING
THE
THICKEST
WATCHCOAT
IS
NO
MORE
OF
A
HOUSE
THAN
THE
UNCLAD
BODY
FOR
AS
THE
SOUL
IS
GLUED
INSIDE
OF
ITS
FLESHY
TABERNACLE
AND
CANNOT
FREELY
MOVE
ABOUT
IN
IT
NOR
EVEN
MOVE
OUT
OF
IT
WITHOUT
RUNNING
GREAT
RISK
OF
PERISHING
LIKE
AN
IGNORANT
PILGRIM
CROSSING
THE
SNOWY
ALPS
IN
WINTER
SO
A
WATCHCOAT
IS
NOT
SO
MUCH
OF
A
HOUSE
AS
IT
IS
A
MERE
ENVELOPE
OR
ADDITIONAL
SKIN
ENCASING
YOU
YOU
CANNOT
PUT
A

OF

IN

AND
NO

CAN
YOU
MAKE
A
CONVENIENT

OF
YOUR
WATCHCOAT
CONCERNING
ALL
THIS
IT
IS
MUCH
TO
BE
DEPLORED
THAT
THE
MASTHEADS
OF
A
SOUTHERN
WHALE
SHIP
ARE
UNPROVIDED
WITH
THOSE
ENVIABLE
LITTLE
TENTS
OR
PULPITS
CALLED
CROWSNESTS
IN
WHICH
THE

OF
THE

OF

IN
THIS
ADMIRABLE
VOLUME
ALL
STANDERS
OF

ARE
FURNISHED
WITH
A
CHARMINGLY
CIRCUMSTANTIAL
ACCOUNT
OF
THE
THEN
RECENTLY
INVENTED

OF
THE
GLACIER
WHICH
WAS
THE

OF
CAPTAIN

HE
CALLED
IT
THE

IN
HONOUR
OF

HE
BEING
THE

AND
FREE
FROM

THE

SOMETHING

IT
IS
FURNISHED
WITH
A

TO

OF

IN

BEING
FIXED
ON

YOU
ASCEND
INTO

THE

IS
A

IN

TO

YOUR

AND
OTHER
NAUTICAL
CONVENIENCES
WHEN
CAPTAIN

IN
PERSON
STOOD
HIS
MASTHEAD
IN
THIS

OF
HIS
HE
TELLS
US
THAT
HE
ALWAYS
HAD
A
RIFLE
WITH
HIM
ALSO
FIXED
IN
THE
RACK
TOGETHER
WITH
A
POWDER
FLASK
AND
SHOT
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
POPPING
OFF
THE
STRAY
NARWHALES
OR
VAGRANT
SEA
UNICORNS
INFESTING
THOSE
WATERS
FOR
YOU
CANNOT
SUCCESSFULLY
SHOOT
AT
THEM
FROM
THE
DECK
OWING
TO
THE
RESISTANCE
OF
THE
WATER
BUT
TO
SHOOT
DOWN
UPON
THEM
IS
A
VERY
DIFFERENT
THING
NOW
IT
WAS
PLAINLY
A
LABOR
OF
LOVE
FOR
CAPTAIN
SLEET
TO
DESCRIBE
AS
HE
DOES
ALL
THE
LITTLE
DETAILED
CONVENIENCES
OF
HIS
CROWSNEST
BUT
THOUGH
HE
SO
ENLARGES
UPON
MANY
OF
THESE
AND
THOUGH
HE
TREATS
US
TO
A
VERY
SCIENTIFIC
ACCOUNT
OF
HIS
EXPERIMENTS
IN
THIS
CROWSNEST
WITH
A
SMALL
COMPASS
HE
KEPT
THERE
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
COUNTERACTING
THE
ERRORS
RESULTING
FROM
WHAT
IS
CALLED
THE
LOCAL
ATTRACTION
OF
ALL
BINNACLE
MAGNETS
AN
ERROR
ASCRIBABLE
TO
THE
HORIZONTAL
VICINITY
OF
THE
IRON
IN
THE
SHIPS
PLANKS
AND
IN
THE
GLACIERS
CASE
PERHAPS
TO
THERE
HAVING
BEEN
SO
MANY
BROKENDOWN
BLACKSMITHS
AMONG
HER
CREW
I
SAY
THAT
THOUGH
THE
CAPTAIN
IS
VERY
DISCREET
AND
SCIENTIFIC
HERE
YET
FOR
ALL
HIS
LEARNED
BINNACLE
DEVIATIONS
AZIMUTH
COMPASS
OBSERVATIONS
AND
APPROXIMATE
ERRORS
HE
KNOWS
VERY
WELL
CAPTAIN
SLEET
THAT
HE
WAS
NOT
SO
MUCH
IMMERSED
IN
THOSE
PROFOUND
MAGNETIC
MEDITATIONS
AS
TO
FAIL
BEING
ATTRACTED
OCCASIONALLY
TOWARDS
THAT
WELL
REPLENISHED
LITTLE
CASEBOTTLE
SO
NICELY
TUCKED
IN
ON
ONE
SIDE
OF
HIS
CROWS
NEST
WITHIN
EASY
REACH
OF
HIS
HAND
THOUGH
UPON
THE
WHOLE
I
GREATLY
ADMIRE
AND
EVEN
LOVE
THE
BRAVE
THE
HONEST
AND
LEARNED
CAPTAIN
YET
I
TAKE
IT
VERY
ILL
OF
HIM
THAT
HE
SHOULD
SO
UTTERLY
IGNORE
THAT
CASEBOTTLE
SEEING
WHAT
A
FAITHFUL
FRIEND
AND
COMFORTER
IT
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
WHILE
WITH
MITTENED
FINGERS
AND
HOODED
HEAD
HE
WAS
STUDYING
THE
MATHEMATICS
ALOFT
THERE
IN
THAT
BIRDS
NEST
WITHIN
THREE
OR
FOUR
PERCHES
OF
THE
POLE
BUT
IF
WE
SOUTHERN
WHALEFISHERS
ARE
NOT
SO
SNUGLY
HOUSED
ALOFT
AS
CAPTAIN
SLEET
AND
HIS
GREENLANDMEN
WERE
YET
THAT
DISADVANTAGE
IS
GREATLY
COUNTERBALANCED
BY
THE
WIDELY
CONTRASTING
SERENITY
OF
THOSE
SEDUCTIVE
SEAS
IN
WHICH
WE
SOUTH
FISHERS
MOSTLY
FLOAT
FOR
ONE
I
USED
TO
LOUNGE
UP
THE
RIGGING
VERY
LEISURELY
RESTING
IN
THE
TOP
TO
HAVE
A
CHAT
WITH
QUEEQUEG
OR
ANY
ONE
ELSE
OFF

WHOM
I
MIGHT
FIND
THERE
THEN
ASCENDING
A
LITTLE

FURTHER
AND
THROWING
A
LAZY
LEG
OVER
THE
TOPSAIL
YARD
TAKE
A
PRELIMINARY
VIEW
OF
THE

PASTURES
AND
SO
AT

MOUNT
TO
MY
ULTIMATE
DESTINATION
LET
ME
MAKE
A
CLEAN
BREAST
OF
IT
HERE
AND
FRANKLY
ADMIT
THAT

SWIMMING
BEFORE
HIS
EXULTING
PURSUERS
WITH
EVERY
APPARENT
SYMPTOM
OF

HE
HAD
SEVERAL
TIMES
BEEN
KNOWN
TO

ROUND
SUDDENLY
AND
BEARING
DOWN
UPON

EITHER
STAVE
THEIR
BOATS
TO
SPLINTERS
OR
DRIVE
THEM
BACK
IN
CONSTERNATION
TO
THEIR

ALREADY
SEVERAL
FATALITIES
HAD
ATTENDED
HIS
CHASE
BUT
THOUGH
SIMILAR
DISASTERS
HOWEVER
LITTLE
BRUITED
ASHORE
WERE
BY
NO
MEANS
UNUSUAL
IN
THE
FISHERY
YET
IN
MOST
INSTANCES
SUCH
SEEMED
THE
WHITE
WHALES
INFERNAL
AFORETHOUGHT
OF

THAT
EVERY
DISMEMBERING
OR
DEATH
THAT
HE
CAUSED
WAS
NOT

REGARDED
AS
HAVING
BEEN
INFLICTED
BY
AN
UNINTELLIGENT
AGENT
JUDGE
THEN
TO
WHAT
PITCHES
OF
INFLAMED
DISTRACTED
FURY
THE
MINDS
OF
HIS
MORE
DESPERATE
HUNTERS
WERE
IMPELLED
WHEN
AMID
THE
CHIPS
OF
CHEWED
BOATS
AND
THE
SINKING
LIMBS
OF
TORN
COMRADES
THEY
SWAM
OUT
OF
THE
WHITE
CURDS
OF
THE
WHALES
DIREFUL
WRATH
INTO
THE
SERENE
EXASPERATING
SUNLIGHT
THAT
SMILED
ON
AS
IF
AT
A
BIRTH
OR
A
BRIDAL
HIS
THREE
BOATS
STOVE
AROUND
HIM
AND
OARS
AND
MEN
BOTH
WHIRLING
IN
THE
EDDIES
ONE
CAPTAIN
SEIZING
THE
LINEKNIFE
FROM
HIS
BROKEN
PROW
HAD
DASHED
AT
THE
WHALE
AS
AN
ARKANSAS
DUELLIST
AT
HIS
FOE
BLINDLY
SEEKING
WITH
A
SIX
INCH
BLADE
TO
REACH
THE
FATHOMDEEP
LIFE
OF
THE
WHALE
THAT
CAPTAIN
WAS
AHAB
AND
THEN
IT
WAS
THAT
SUDDENLY
SWEEPING
HIS
SICKLESHAPED
LOWER
JAW
BENEATH
HIM
MOBY
DICK
HAD
REAPED
AWAY
AHABS
LEG
AS
A

A
BLADE
OF

IN
THE
FIELD
NO
TURBANED
TURK
NO
HIRED
VENETIAN
OR

COULD
HAVE
SMOTE
HIM
WITH

SEEMING
MALICE
SMALL
REASON
WAS
THERE
TO
DOUBT
THEN
THAT
EVER
SINCE
THAT
ALMOST
FATAL
ENCOUNTER
AHAB
HAD
CHERISHED
A
WILD
VINDICTIVENESS
AGAINST
THE
WHALE
ALL
THE
MORE
FELL
FOR
THAT
IN
HIS
FRANTIC
MORBIDNESS
HE
AT
LAST
CAME
TO
IDENTIFY
WITH
HIM
NOT
ONLY
ALL
HIS
BODILY
WOES
BUT
ALL
HIS
INTELLECTUAL
AND
SPIRITUAL
EXASPERATIONS
THE
WHITE
WHALE
SWAM
BEFORE
HIM
AS
THE
MONOMANIAC
INCARNATION
OF
ALL
THOSE
MALICIOUS
AGENCIES
WHICH
SOME
DEEP
MEN
FEEL
EATING
IN
THEM
TILL
THEY
ARE
LEFT
LIVING
ON
WITH
HALF
A
HEART
AND
HALF
A
LUNG
THAT
INTANGIBLE
MALIGNITY
WHICH
HAS
BEEN
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
TO
WHOSE
DOMINION
EVEN
THE
MODERN
CHRISTIANS
ASCRIBE
ONEHALF
OF
THE
WORLDS
WHICH
THE
ANCIENT
OPHITES
OF
THE
EAST
REVERENCED
IN
THEIR
STATUE
DEVILAHAB
DID
NOT
FALL
DOWN
AND
WORSHIP
IT
LIKE
THEM
BUT
DELIRIOUSLY
TRANSFERRING
ITS
IDEA
TO
THE
ABHORRED
WHITE
WHALE
HE
PITTED
HIMSELF
ALL
MUTILATED
AGAINST
IT
ALL
THAT
MOST
MADDENS
AND
TORMENTS
ALL
THAT
STIRS
UP
THE
LEES
OF
THINGS
ALL
TRUTH
WITH
MALICE
IN
IT
ALL
THAT
CRACKS
THE
SINEWS
AND
CAKES
THE
BRAIN
ALL
THE
SUBTLE
DEMONISMS
OF
LIFE
AND
THOUGHT
ALL
EVIL
TO
CRAZY
AHAB
WERE
VISIBLY
PERSONIFIED
AND
MADE
PRACTICALLY
ASSAILABLE
IN
MOBY
DICK
HE
PILED
UPON
THE
WHALES
WHITE
HUMP
THE
SUM
OF
ALL
THE
GENERAL
RAGE
AND
HATE
FELT
BY
HIS
WHOLE
RACE
FROM
ADAM
DOWN
AND
THEN
AS
IF
HIS
CHEST
HAD
BEEN
A
MORTAR
HE
BURST
HIS
HOT
HEARTS
SHELL
UPON
IT
IT
IS
NOT
PROBABLE
THAT
THIS
MONOMANIA
IN
HIM
TOOK
ITS
INSTANT
RISE
AT
THE
PRECISE
TIME
OF
HIS
BODILY
DISMEMBERMENT
THEN
IN
DARTING
AT
THE
MONSTER
KNIFE
IN
HAND
HE
HAD
BUT
GIVEN
LOOSE
TO
A
SUDDEN
PASSIONATE
CORPORAL
ANIMOSITY
AND
WHEN
HE
RECEIVED
THE
STROKE
THAT
TORE
HIM
HE
PROBABLY
BUT
FELT
THE
AGONIZING
BODILY
LACERATION
BUT
NOTHING
MORE
YET
WHEN
BY
THIS
COLLISION
FORCED
TO
TURN
TOWARDS
HOME
AND
FOR
LONG
MONTHS
OF
DAYS
AND
WEEKS
AHAB
AND
ANGUISH
LAY
STRETCHED
TOGETHER
IN
ONE
HAMMOCK
ROUNDING
IN
MID
WINTER
THAT
DREARY
HOWLING
PATAGONIAN
CAPE
THEN
IT
WAS
THAT
HIS
TORN
BODY
AND
GASHED
SOUL
BLED
INTO
ONE
ANOTHER
AND
SO
INTERFUSING
MADE
HIM
MAD
THAT
IT
WAS
ONLY
THEN
ON
THE
HOMEWARD
VOYAGE
AFTER
THE
ENCOUNTER
THAT
THE
FINAL
MONOMANIA
SEIZED
HIM
SEEMS
ALL
BUT
CERTAIN
FROM
THE
FACT
THAT
AT
INTERVALS
DURING
THE
PASSAGE
HE
WAS
A
RAVING
LUNATIC
AND
THOUGH
UNLIMBED
OF
A
LEG
YET
SUCH
VITAL
STRENGTH
YET
LURKED
IN
HIS
EGYPTIAN
CHEST
AND
WAS
MOREOVER
INTENSIFIED
BY
HIS
DELIRIUM
THAT
HIS
MATES
WERE
FORCED
TO
LACE
HIM
FAST
EVEN
THERE
AS
HE
SAILED
RAVING
IN
HIS
HAMMOCK
IN
A
STRAITJACKET
HE
SWUNG
TO
THE
MAD
ROCKINGS
OF
THE
GALES
AND
WHEN
RUNNING
INTO
MORE
SUFFERABLE
LATITUDES
THE
SHIP
WITH
MILD
STUNSAILS
SPREAD
FLOATED
ACROSS
THE
TRANQUIL
TROPICS
AND
TO
ALL
APPEARANCES
THE
OLD
MANS
DELIRIUM
SEEMED
LEFT
BEHIND
HIM
WITH
THE
CAPE
HORN
SWELLS
AND
HE
CAME
FORTH
FROM
HIS
DARK
DEN
INTO
THE
BLESSED
LIGHT
AND
AIR
EVEN
THEN
WHEN
HE
BORE
THAT
FIRM
COLLECTED
FRONT
HOWEVER
PALE
AND
ISSUED
HIS
CALM
ORDERS
ONCE
AGAIN
AND
HIS
MATES
THANKED
GOD
THE
DIREFUL
MADNESS
WAS
NOW
GONE
EVEN
THEN
AHAB
IN
HIS
HIDDEN
SELF
RAVED
ON
HUMAN
MADNESS
IS
OFTENTIMES
A
CUNNING
AND
MOST
FELINE
THING
WHEN
YOU
THINK
IT
FLED
IT
MAY
HAVE
BUT
BECOME
TRANSFIGURED
INTO
SOME
STILL
SUBTLER
FORM
AHABS
FULL
LUNACY
SUBSIDED
NOT
BUT
DEEPENINGLY
CONTRACTED
LIKE
THE
UNABATED
HUDSON
WHEN
THAT
NOBLE
NORTHMAN
FLOWS
NARROWLY
BUT
UNFATHOMABLY
THROUGH
THE
HIGHLAND
GORGE
BUT
AS
IN
HIS
NARROWFLOWING
MONOMANIA
NOT
ONE
JOT
OF
AHABS
BROAD
MADNESS
HAD
BEEN
LEFT
BEHIND
SO
IN
THAT
BROAD
MADNESS
NOT
ONE
JOT
OF
HIS
GREAT
NATURAL
INTELLECT
HAD
PERISHED
THAT
BEFORE
LIVING
AGENT
NOW
BECAME
THE
LIVING
INSTRUMENT
IF
SUCH
A
FURIOUS
TROPE
MAY
STAND
HIS
SPECIAL
LUNACY
STORMED
HIS
GENERAL
SANITY
AND
CARRIED
IT
AND
TURNED
ALL
ITS
CONCENTRED
CANNON
UPON
ITS
OWN
MAD
MARK
SO
THAT
FAR
FROM
HAVING
LOST
HIS
STRENGTH
AHAB
TO
THAT
ONE
END
DID
NOW
POSSESS
A
THOUSAND
FOLD
MORE
POTENCY
THAN
EVER
HE
HAD
SANELY
BROUGHT
TO
BEAR
UPON
ANY
ONE
REASONABLE
OBJECT
THIS
IS
MUCH
YET
AHABS
LARGER
DARKER
DEEPER
PART
REMAINS
UNHINTED
BUT
VAIN
TO
POPULARIZE
PROFUNDITIES
AND
ALL
TRUTH
IS
PROFOUND
WINDING
FAR
DOWN
FROM
WITHIN
THE
VERY
HEART
OF
THIS
SPIKED
HOTEL
DE
CLUNY
WHERE

STANDHOWEVER
GRAND
AND
WONDERFUL
NOW
QUIT

TAKE
YOUR
WAY
YE
NOBLER
SADDER

TO
THOSE
VAST
ROMAN
HALLS
OF

WHERE
FAR
BENEATH
THE
FANTASTIC
TOWERS
OF

UPPER

HIS
ROOT
OF
GRANDEUR
HIS
WHOLE
AWFUL
ESSENCE
SITS
IN
BEARDED
STATE
AN
ANTIQUE
BURIED
BENEATH
ANTIQUITIES
AND
THRONED
ON
TORSOES
SO
WITH
A
BROKEN
THRONE
THE
GREAT

MOCK
THAT
CAPTIVE
KING
SO
LIKE
A
CARYATID

PATIENT
SITS
UPHOLDING
ON
HIS
FROZEN

THE
PILED

OF

YE

AND
FROM
YOUR
GRIM
SIRE
ONLY
WILL
THE
OLD

COME
NOW
IN
HIS

AHAB
HAD
SOME
GLIMPSE
OF
THIS
NAMELY
ALL
MY
MEANS
ARE
SANE
MY
MOTIVE
AND
MY
OBJECT
MAD
YET
WITHOUT
POWER
TO
KILL
OR
CHANGE
OR
SHUN
THE
FACT
HE
LIKEWISE
KNEW
THAT
TO
MANKIND
HE
DID
LONG
DISSEMBLE
IN
SOME
SORT
DID
STILL
BUT
THAT
THING
OF
HIS
DISSEMBLING
WAS
ONLY
SUBJECT
TO
HIS
PERCEPTIBILITY
NOT
TO
HIS
WILL
DETERMINATE
NEVERTHELESS
SO
WELL
DID
HE
SUCCEED
IN
THAT
DISSEMBLING
THAT
WHEN
WITH
IVORY
LEG
HE
STEPPED
ASHORE
AT
LAST
NO
NANTUCKETER
THOUGHT
HIM
OTHERWISE
THAN
BUT
NATURALLY
GRIEVED
AND
THAT
TO
THE
QUICK
WITH
THE
TERRIBLE
CASUALTY
WHICH
HAD
OVERTAKEN
HIM
THE
REPORT
OF
HIS
UNDENIABLE
DELIRIUM
AT
SEA
WAS
LIKEWISE
POPULARLY
ASCRIBED
TO
A
KINDRED
CAUSE
AND
SO
TOO
ALL
THE
ADDED
MOODINESS
WHICH
ALWAYS
AFTERWARDS
TO
THE
VERY
DAY
OF
SAILING
IN
THE
PEQUOD
ON
THE
PRESENT
VOYAGE
SAT
BROODING
ON
HIS
BROW
NOR
IS
IT
SO
VERY
UNLIKELY
THAT
FAR
FROM
DISTRUSTING
HIS
FITNESS
FOR
ANOTHER
