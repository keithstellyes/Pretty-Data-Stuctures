_The
pale_Usher--threadbare
in_coat,

I_see
him_now.
_He
was_ever
dusting_his
old_lexicons

with_a
queer_handkerchief,
mockingly_embellished
with_all
the_gay
flags_of
all_the

He_loved
to_dust
his_old
grammars;_it
somehow_mildly
reminded_him
of_his
mortality._

_It
will_be
seen_that
this_mere
painstaking_burrower
and_grub-worm
of_a
poor_devil
of_a
Sub-Sub_appears
to_have
gone_through
the_long
Vaticans_and
street-stalls_of
the_earth,
picking_up
whatever_random
allusions_to
whales_he
could_anyways
find_in
any_book
whatsoever,_sacred
or_profane.
_Therefore
you_must
not,_in
every_case
at_least,
take_the
higgledy-piggledy_whale
statements,_however
authentic,_in
these_extracts,
for_veritable
gospel_cetology.
_Far
from_it.
_As
touching_the
ancient_authors
generally,_as
well_as
the_poets
here_appearing,
these_extracts
are_solely
valuable_or
entertaining,_as
affording_a
glancing_bird's
eye_view
of_what
has_been
promiscuously_said,
thought,_fancied,
and_sung
of_Leviathan,
by_many
nations_and
generations,_including
our_own.
_So
fare_thee
well,_poor
devil_of
a_Sub-Sub,
whose_commentator
I_am.
Thou_belongest
to_that
hopeless,_sallow
tribe_which
no_wine
of_this
world_will
ever_warm;
and_for
whom_even
Pale_Sherry
would_be
too_rosy-strong;
but_with
whom_one
sometimes_loves
to_sit,
and_feel
poor-devilish,_too;
and_grow
convivial_upon
tears;_and
say_to
them_bluntly,
with_full
eyes_and
empty_glasses,
and_in
not_altogether
unpleasant_sadness--Give
it_up,
Sub-Subs!_
For_by
how_much
the_more
pains_ye
take_to
please_the
world,_by
so_much
the_more
shall_ye
for_ever
go_thankless!
_Would
that_I
could_clear
out_Hampton
Court_and
the_Tuileries
for_ye!
_But
gulp_down
your_tears
and_hie
aloft_to
the_royal-mast
with_your
hearts;_for
your_friends
who_have
gone_before
are_clearing
out_the
seven-storied_heavens,
and_making
refugees_of
long-pampered_Gabriel,
Michael,_and
Raphael,_against
your_coming.
Here_ye
strike_but
splintered_hearts
together--there,_ye
shall_strike
unsplinterable_glasses!

_CHAPTER
1_
Loomings._
_Call
me_Ishmael.
_Some
years_ago--never
mind_how
long_precisely--having
little_or
no_money
in_my
purse,_and
nothing_particular
to_interest
me_on
shore,_I
thought_I
would_sail
about_a
little_and
see_the
watery_part
of_the
world._
It_is
a_way
I_have
of_driving
off_the
spleen_and
regulating_the
circulation._
Whenever_I
find_myself
growing_grim
about_the
mouth;_whenever
it_is
a_damp,
drizzly_November
in_my
soul;_whenever
I_find
myself_involuntarily
pausing_before
coffin_warehouses,
and_bringing
up_the
rear_of
every_funeral
I_meet;
and_especially
whenever_my
hypos_get
such_an
upper_hand
of_me,
that_it
requires_a
strong_moral
principle_to
prevent_me
from_deliberately
stepping_into
the_street,
and_methodically
knocking_people's
hats_off--then,
I_account
it_high
time_to
get_to
sea_as
soon_as
I_can.
_This
is_my
substitute_for
pistol_and
ball._
With_a
philosophical_flourish
Cato_throws
himself_upon
his_sword;
I_quietly
take_to
the_ship.
_There
is_nothing
surprising_in
this._
If_they
but_knew
it,_almost
all_men
in_their
degree,_some
time_or
other,_cherish
very_nearly
the_same
feelings_towards
the_ocean
with_me.
_There
now_is
your_insular
city_of
the_Manhattoes,
belted_round
by_wharves
as_Indian
isles_by
coral_reefs--commerce
surrounds_it
with_her
surf._
Right_and
left,_the
streets_take
you_waterward.
_Its
extreme_downtown
is_the
battery,_where
that_noble
mole_is
washed_by
waves,_and
cooled_by
breezes,_which
a_few
hours_previous
were_out
of_sight
of_land.
_Look
at_the
crowds_of
water-gazers_there.
_Circumambulate
the_city
of_a
dreamy_Sabbath
afternoon._
Go_from
Corlears_Hook
to_Coenties
Slip,_and
from_thence,
by_Whitehall,
northward._
What_do
you_see?--Posted
like_silent
sentinels_all
around_the
town,_stand
thousands_upon
thousands_of
mortal_men
fixed_in
ocean_reveries.
_Some
leaning_against
the_spiles;
some_seated
upon_the
pier-heads;_some
looking_over
the_bulwarks
of_ships
from_China;
some_high
aloft_in
the_rigging,
as_if
striving_to
get_a
still_better
seaward_peep.
_But
these_are
all_landsmen;
of_week
days_pent
up_in
lath_and
plaster--tied_to
counters,_nailed
to_benches,
clinched_to
desks._
How_then
is_this?
_Are
the_green
fields_gone?
_What
do_they
here?_
But_look!
here_come
more_crowds,
pacing_straight
for_the
water,_and
seemingly_bound
for_a
dive._
Strange!_
Nothing_will
content_them
but_the
extremest_limit
of_the
land;_loitering
under_the
shady_lee
of_yonder
warehouses_will
not_suffice.
_No.
_They
must_get
just_as
nigh_the
water_as
they_possibly
can_without
falling_in.
_And
there_they
stand--miles_of
them--leagues._
Inlanders_all,
they_come
from_lanes
and_alleys,
streets_and
avenues--north,_east,
south,_and
west._
Yet_here
they_all
unite._
Tell_me,
does_the
magnetic_virtue
of_the
needles_of
the_compasses
of_all
those_ships
attract_them
thither?_
Once_more.
_Say
you_are
in_the
country;_in
some_high
land_of
lakes._Take
almost_any
path_you
please,_and
ten_to
one_it
carries_you
down_in
a_dale,
and_leaves
you_there
by_a
pool_in
the_stream.
_There
is_magic
in_it.
_Let
the_most
absent-minded_of
men_be
plunged_in
his_deepest
reveries--stand_that
man_on
his_legs,
set_his
feet_a-going,
and_he
will_infallibly
lead_you
to_water,
if_water
there_be
in_all
that_region.
_Should
you_ever
be_athirst
in_the
great_American
desert,_try
this_experiment,
if_your
caravan_happen
to_be
supplied_with
a_metaphysical
professor._
Yes,_as
every_one
knows,_meditation
and_water
are_wedded
for_ever.
_But
here_is
an_artist.
_He
desires_to
paint_you
the_dreamiest,
shadiest,_quietest,
most_enchanting
bit_of
romantic_landscape
in_all
the_valley
of_the
Saco._
What_is
the_chief
element_he
employs?_
There_stand
his_trees,
each_with
a_hollow
trunk,_as
if_a
hermit_and
a_crucifix
were_within;
and_here
sleeps_his
meadow,_and
there_sleep
his_cattle;
and_up
from_yonder
cottage_goes
a_sleepy
smoke._
Deep_into
distant_woodlands
winds_a
mazy_way,
reaching_to
overlapping_spurs
of_mountains
bathed_in
their_hill-side
blue._
But_though
the_picture
lies_thus
tranced,_and
though_this
pine-tree_shakes
down_its
sighs_like
leaves_upon
this_shepherd's
head,_yet
all_were
vain,_unless
the_shepherd's
eye_were
fixed_upon
the_magic
stream_before
him._
Go_visit
the_Prairies
in_June,
when_for
scores_on
scores_of
miles_you
wade_knee-deep
among_Tiger-lilies--what
is_the
one_charm
wanting?--Water--there_is
not_a
drop_of
water_there!
_Were
Niagara_but
a_cataract
of_sand,
would_you
travel_your
thousand_miles
to_see
it?_
Why_did
the_poor
poet_of
Tennessee,_upon
suddenly_receiving
two_handfuls
of_silver,
deliberate_whether
to_buy
him_a
coat,_which
he_sadly
needed,_or
invest_his
money_in
a_pedestrian
trip_to
Rockaway_Beach?
_Why
is_almost
every_robust
healthy_boy
with_a
robust_healthy
soul_in
him,_at
some_time
or_other
crazy_to
go_to
sea?_
Why_upon
your_first
voyage_as
a_passenger,
did_you
yourself_feel
such_a
mystical_vibration,
when_first
told_that
you_and
your_ship
were_now
out_of
sight_of
land?_
Why_did
the_old
Persians_hold
the_sea
holy?_
Why_did
the_Greeks
give_it
a_separate
deity,_and
own_brother
of_Jove?
_Surely
all_this
is_not
without_meaning.
_And
still_deeper
the_meaning
of_that
story_of
Narcissus,_who
because_he
could_not
grasp_the
tormenting,_mild
image_he
saw_in
the_fountain,
plunged_into
it_and
was_drowned.
_But
that_same
image,_we
ourselves_see
in_all
rivers_and
oceans._
It_is
the_image
of_the
ungraspable_phantom
of_life;
and_this
is_the
key_to
it_all.
_Now,
when_I
say_that
I_am
in_the
habit_of
going_to
sea_whenever
I_begin
to_grow
hazy_about
the_eyes,
and_begin
to_be
over_conscious
of_my
lungs,_I
do_not
mean_to
have_it
inferred_that
I_ever
go_to
sea_as
a_passenger.
_For
to_go
as_a
passenger_you
must_needs
have_a
purse,_and
a_purse
is_but
a_rag
unless_you
have_something
in_it.
_Besides,
passengers_get
sea-sick--grow_quarrelsome--don't
sleep_of
nights--do_not
enjoy_themselves
much,_as
a_general
thing;--no,_I
never_go
as_a
passenger;_nor,
though_I
am_something
of_a
salt,_do
I_ever
go_to
sea_as
a_Commodore,
or_a
Captain,_or
a_Cook.
_I
abandon_the
glory_and
distinction_of
such_offices
to_those
who_like
them._
For_my
part,_I
abominate_all
honourable_respectable
toils,_trials,
and_tribulations
of_every
kind_whatsoever.
_It
is_quite
as_much
as_I
can_do
to_take
care_of
myself,_without
taking_care
of_ships,
barques,_brigs,
schooners,_and
what_not.
_And
as_for
going_as
cook,--though_I
confess_there
is_considerable
glory_in
that,_a
cook_being
a_sort
of_officer
on_ship-board--yet,
somehow,_I
never_fancied
broiling_fowls;--though
once_broiled,
judiciously_buttered,
and_judgmatically
salted_and
peppered,_there
is_no
one_who
will_speak
more_respectfully,
not_to
say_reverentially,
of_a
broiled_fowl
than_I
will._
It_is
out_of
the_idolatrous
dotings_of
the_old
Egyptians_upon
broiled_ibis
and_roasted
river_horse,
that_you
see_the
mummies_of
those_creatures
in_their
huge_bake-houses
the_pyramids.
_No,
when_I
go_to
sea,_I
go_as
a_simple
sailor,_right
before_the
mast,_plumb
down_into
the_forecastle,
aloft_there
to_the
royal_mast-head.
True,_they
rather_order
me_about
some,_and
make_me
jump_from
spar_to
spar,_like
a_grasshopper
in_a
May_meadow.
_And
at_first,
this_sort
of_thing
is_unpleasant
enough._
It_touches
one's_sense
of_honour,
particularly_if
you_come
of_an
old_established
family_in
the_land,
the_Van
Rensselaers,_or
Randolphs,_or
Hardicanutes._
And_more
than_all,
if_just
previous_to
putting_your
hand_into
the_tar-pot,
you_have
been_lording
it_as
a_country
schoolmaster,_making
the_tallest
boys_stand
in_awe
of_you.
_The
transition_is
a_keen
one,_I
assure_you,
from_a
schoolmaster_to
a_sailor,
and_requires
a_strong
decoction_of
Seneca_and
the_Stoics
to_enable
you_to
grin_and
bear_it.
_But
even_this
wears_off
in_time.
_What
of_it,
if_some
old_hunks
of_a
sea-captain_orders
me_to
get_a
broom_and
sweep_down
the_decks?
_What
does_that
indignity_amount
to,_weighed,
I_mean,
in_the
scales_of
the_New
Testament?_
Do_you
think_the
archangel_Gabriel
thinks_anything
the_less
of_me,
because_I
promptly_and
respectfully_obey
that_old
hunks_in
that_particular
instance?_
Who_ain't
a_slave?
_Tell
me_that.
_Well,
then,_however
the_old
sea-captains_may
order_me
about--however_they
may_thump
and_punch
me_about,
I_have
the_satisfaction
of_knowing
that_it
is_all
right;_that
everybody_else
is_one
way_or
other_served
in_much
the_same
way--either_in
a_physical
or_metaphysical
point_of
view,_that
is;_and
so_the
universal_thump
is_passed
round,_and
all_hands
should_rub
each_other's
shoulder-blades,_and
be_content.
_Again,
I_always
go_to
sea_as
a_sailor,
because_they
make_a
point_of
paying_me
for_my
trouble,_whereas
they_never
pay_passengers
a_single
penny_that
I_ever
heard_of.
_On
the_contrary,
passengers_themselves
must_pay.
_And
there_is
all_the
difference_in
the_world
between_paying
and_being
paid._
The_act
of_paying
is_perhaps
the_most
uncomfortable_infliction
that_the
two_orchard
thieves_entailed
upon_us.
_But
BEING_PAID,--what
will_compare
with_it?
_The
urbane_activity
with_which
a_man
receives_money
is_really
marvellous,_considering
that_we
so_earnestly
believe_money
to_be
the_root
of_all
earthly_ills,
and_that
on_no
account_can
a_monied
man_enter
heaven._
Ah!_how
cheerfully_we
consign_ourselves
to_perdition!
_Finally,
I_always
go_to
sea_as
a_sailor,
because_of
the_wholesome
exercise_and
pure_air
of_the
fore-castle_deck.
_For
as_in
this_world,
head_winds
are_far
more_prevalent
than_winds
from_astern
(that_is,
if_you
never_violate
the_Pythagorean
maxim),_so
for_the
most_part
the_Commodore
on_the
quarter-deck_gets
his_atmosphere
at_second
hand_from
the_sailors
on_the
forecastle._
He_thinks
he_breathes
it_first;
but_not
so._
In_much
the_same
way_do
the_commonalty
lead_their
leaders_in
many_other
things,_at
the_same
time_that
the_leaders
little_suspect
it._
But_wherefore
it_was
that_after
having_repeatedly
smelt_the
sea_as
a_merchant
sailor,_I
should_now
take_it
into_my
head_to
go_on
a_whaling
voyage;_this
the_invisible
police_officer
of_the
Fates,_who
has_the
constant_surveillance
of_me,
and_secretly
dogs_me,
and_influences
me_in
some_unaccountable
way--he_can
better_answer
than_any
one_else.
_And,
doubtless,_my
going_on
this_whaling
voyage,_formed
part_of
the_grand
programme_of
Providence_that
was_drawn
up_a
long_time
ago._
It_came
in_as
a_sort
of_brief
interlude_and
solo_between
more_extensive
performances._
I_take
it_that
this_part
of_the
bill_must
have_run
something_like
this:_

IN_AFFGHANISTAN."
_
Though_I
cannot_tell
why_it
was_exactly
that_those
stage_managers,
the_Fates,
put_me
down_for
this_shabby
part_of
a_whaling
voyage,_when
others_were
set_down
for_magnificent
parts_in
high_tragedies,
and_short
and_easy
parts_in
genteel_comedies,
and_jolly
parts_in
farces--though_I
cannot_tell
why_this
was_exactly;
yet,_now
that_I
recall_all
the_circumstances,
I_think
I_can
see_a
little_into
the_springs
and_motives
which_being
cunningly_presented
to_me
under_various
disguises,_induced
me_to
set_about
performing_the
part_I
did,_besides
cajoling_me
into_the
delusion_that
it_was
a_choice
resulting_from
my_own
unbiased_freewill
and_discriminating
judgment._
Chief_among
these_motives
was_the
overwhelming_idea
of_the
great_whale
himself._
Such_a
portentous_and
mysterious_monster
roused_all
my_curiosity.
_Then
the_wild
and_distant
seas_where
he_rolled
his_island
bulk;_the
undeliverable,_nameless
perils_of
the_whale;
these,_with
all_the
attending_marvels
of_a
thousand_Patagonian
sights_and
sounds,_helped
to_sway
me_to
my_wish.
_With
other_men,
perhaps,_such
things_would
not_have
been_inducements;
but_as
for_me,
I_am
tormented_with
an_everlasting
itch_for
things_remote.
_I
love_to
sail_forbidden
seas,_and
land_on
barbarous_coasts.
_Not
ignoring_what
is_good,
I_am
quick_to
perceive_a
horror,_and
could_still
be_social
with_it--would
they_let
me--since_it
is_but
well_to
be_on
friendly_terms
with_all
the_inmates
of_the
place_one
lodges_in.
_By
reason_of
these_things,
then,_the
whaling_voyage
was_welcome;
the_great
flood-gates_of
the_wonder-world
swung_open,
and_in
the_wild
conceits_that
swayed_me
to_my
purpose,_two
and_two
there_floated
into_my
inmost_soul,
endless_processions
of_the
whale,_and,
mid_most
of_them
all,_one
grand_hooded
phantom,_like
a_snow
hill_in
the_air.
_
_CHAPTER
2_
The_Carpet-Bag.
_
I_stuffed
a_shirt
or_two
into_my
old_carpet-bag,
tucked_it
under_my
arm,_and
started_for
Cape_Horn
and_the
Pacific._
Quitting_the
good_city
of_old
Manhatto,_I
duly_arrived
in_New
Bedford._
It_was
a_Saturday
night_in
December._
Much_was
I_disappointed
upon_learning
that_the
little_packet
for_Nantucket
had_already
sailed,_and
that_no
way_of
reaching_that
place_would
offer,_till
the_following
Monday._
As_most
young_candidates
for_the
pains_and
penalties_of
whaling_stop
at_this
same_New
Bedford,_thence
to_embark
on_their
voyage,_it
may_as
well_be
related_that
I,_for
one,_had
no_idea
of_so
doing._
For_my
mind_was
made_up
to_sail
in_no
other_than
a_Nantucket
craft,_because
there_was
a_fine,
boisterous_something
about_everything
connected_with
that_famous
old_island,
which_amazingly
pleased_me.
_Besides
though_New
Bedford_has
of_late
been_gradually
monopolising_the
business_of
whaling,_and
though_in
this_matter
poor_old
Nantucket_is
now_much
behind_her,
yet_Nantucket
was_her
great_original--the
Tyre_of
this_Carthage;--the
place_where
the_first
dead_American
whale_was
stranded._
Where_else
but_from
Nantucket_did
those_aboriginal
whalemen,_the
Red-Men,_first
sally_out
in_canoes
to_give
chase_to
the_Leviathan?
_And
where_but
from_Nantucket,
too,_did
that_first
adventurous_little
sloop_put
forth,_partly
laden_with
imported_cobblestones--so
goes_the
story--to_throw
at_the
whales,_in
order_to
discover_when
they_were
nigh_enough
to_risk
a_harpoon
from_the
bowsprit?_
Now_having
a_night,
a_day,
and_still
another_night
following_before
me_in
New_Bedford,
ere_I
could_embark
for_my
destined_port,
it_became
a_matter
of_concernment
where_I
was_to
eat_and
sleep_meanwhile.
_It
was_a
very_dubious-looking,
nay,_a
very_dark
and_dismal
night,_bitingly
cold_and
cheerless._
I_knew
no_one
in_the
place._
With_anxious
grapnels_I
had_sounded
my_pocket,
and_only
brought_up
a_few
pieces_of
silver,--So,_wherever
you_go,
Ishmael,_said
I_to
myself,_as
I_stood
in_the
middle_of
a_dreary
street_shouldering
my_bag,
and_comparing
the_gloom
towards_the
north_with
the_darkness
towards_the
south--wherever_in
your_wisdom
you_may
conclude_to
lodge_for
the_night,
my_dear
Ishmael,_be
sure_to
inquire_the
price,_and
don't_be
too_particular.
_With
halting_steps
I_paced
the_streets,
and_passed
the_sign
of_"The
Crossed_Harpoons"--but
it_looked
too_expensive
and_jolly
there._Further
on,_from
the_bright
red_windows
of_the
"Sword-Fish_Inn,"
there_came
such_fervent
rays,_that
it_seemed
to_have
melted_the
packed_snow
and_ice
from_before
the_house,
for_everywhere
else_the
congealed_frost
lay_ten
inches_thick
in_a
hard,_asphaltic
pavement,--rather_weary
for_me,
when_I
struck_my
foot_against
the_flinty
projections,_because
from_hard,
remorseless_service
the_soles
of_my
boots_were
in_a
most_miserable
plight._
Too_expensive
and_jolly,
again_thought
I,_pausing
one_moment
to_watch
the_broad
glare_in
the_street,
and_hear
the_sounds
of_the
tinkling_glasses
within._But
go_on,
Ishmael,_said
I_at
last;_don't
you_hear?
get_away
from_before
the_door;
your_patched
boots_are
stopping_the
way._
So_on
I_went.
_I
now_by
instinct_followed
the_streets
that_took
me_waterward,
for_there,
doubtless,_were
the_cheapest,
if_not
the_cheeriest
inns._
Such_dreary
streets!_blocks
of_blackness,
not_houses,
on_either
hand,_and
here_and
there_a
candle,_like
a_candle
moving_about
in_a
tomb._
At_this
hour_of
the_night,
of_the
last_day
of_the
week,_that
quarter_of
the_town
proved_all
but_deserted.
_But
presently_I
came_to
a_smoky
light_proceeding
from_a
low,_wide
building,_the
door_of
which_stood
invitingly_open.
_It
had_a
careless_look,
as_if
it_were
meant_for
the_uses
of_the
public;_so,
entering,_the
first_thing
I_did
was_to
stumble_over
an_ash-box
in_the
porch._
Ha!_thought
I,_ha,
as_the
flying_particles
almost_choked
me,_are
these_ashes
from_that
destroyed_city,
Gomorrah?_
But_"The
Crossed_Harpoons,"
and_"The
Sword-Fish?"--this,_then
must_needs
be_the
sign_of
"The_Trap."
However,_I
picked_myself
up_and
hearing_a
loud_voice
within,_pushed
on_and
opened_a
second,_interior
door._
It_seemed
the_great
Black_Parliament
sitting_in
Tophet._
A_hundred
black_faces
turned_round
in_their
rows_to
peer;_and
beyond,_a
black_Angel
of_Doom
was_beating
a_book
in_a
pulpit._
It_was
a_negro
church;_and
the_preacher's
text_was
about_the
blackness_of
darkness,_and
the_weeping
and_wailing
and_teeth-gnashing
there._
Ha,_Ishmael,
muttered_I,
backing_out,
Wretched_entertainment
at_the
sign_of
'The_Trap!'
_Moving
on,_I
at_last
came_to
a_dim
sort_of
light_not
far_from
the_docks,
and_heard
a_forlorn
creaking_in
the_air;
and_looking
up,_saw
a_swinging
sign_over
the_door
with_a
white_painting
upon_it,
faintly_representing
a_tall
straight_jet
of_misty
spray,_and
these_words
underneath--"The_Spouter
Inn:--Peter_Coffin."
_Coffin?--Spouter?--Rather
ominous_in
that_particular
connexion,_thought
I._
But_it
is_a
common_name
in_Nantucket,
they_say,
and_I
suppose_this
Peter_here
is_an
emigrant_from
there._
As_the
light_looked
so_dim,
and_the
place,_for
the_time,
looked_quiet
enough,_and
the_dilapidated
little_wooden
house_itself
looked_as
if_it
might_have
been_carted
here_from
the_ruins
of_some
burnt_district,
and_as
the_swinging
sign_had
a_poverty-stricken
sort_of
creak_to
it,_I
thought_that
here_was
the_very
spot_for
cheap_lodgings,
and_the
best_of
pea_coffee.
_It
was_a
queer_sort
of_place--a
gable-ended_old
house,_one
side_palsied
as_it
were,_and
leaning_over
sadly._
It_stood
on_a
sharp_bleak
corner,_where
that_tempestuous
wind_Euroclydon
kept_up
a_worse
howling_than
ever_it
did_about
poor_Paul's
tossed_craft.
_Euroclydon,
nevertheless,_is
a_mighty
pleasant_zephyr
to_any
one_in-doors,
with_his
feet_on
the_hob
quietly_toasting
for_bed.
_"In
judging_of
that_tempestuous
wind_called
Euroclydon,"_says
an_old
writer--of_whose
works_I
possess_the
only_copy
extant--"it_maketh
a_marvellous
difference,_whether
thou_lookest
out_at
it_from
a_glass
window_where
the_frost
is_all
on_the
outside,_or
whether_thou
observest_it
from_that
sashless_window,
where_the
frost_is
on_both
sides,_and
of_which
the_wight
Death_is
the_only
glazier."_
True_enough,
thought_I,
as_this
passage_occurred
to_my
mind--old_black-letter,
thou_reasonest
well._
Yes,_these
eyes_are
windows,_and
this_body
of_mine
is_the
house._
What_a
pity_they
didn't_stop
up_the
chinks_and
the_crannies
though,_and
thrust_in
a_little
lint_here
and_there.
_But
it's_too
late_to
make_any
improvements_now.
_The
universe_is
finished;_the
copestone_is
on,_and
the_chips
were_carted
off_a
million_years
ago._Poor
Lazarus_there,
chattering_his
teeth_against
the_curbstone
for_his
pillow,_and
shaking_off
his_tatters
with_his
shiverings,_he
might_plug
up_both
ears_with
rags,_and
put_a
corn-cob_into
his_mouth,
and_yet
that_would
not_keep
out_the
tempestuous_Euroclydon.
_Euroclydon!
says_old
Dives,_in
his_red
silken_wrapper--(he
had_a
redder_one
afterwards)_pooh,
pooh!_
What_a
fine_frosty
night;_how
Orion_glitters;
what_northern
lights!_
Let_them
talk_of
their_oriental
summer_climes
of_everlasting
conservatories;_give
me_the
privilege_of
making_my
own_summer
with_my
own_coals.
_But
what_thinks
Lazarus?_
Can_he
warm_his
blue_hands
by_holding
them_up
to_the
grand_northern
lights?_
Would_not
Lazarus_rather
be_in
Sumatra_than
here?_
Would_he
not_far
rather_lay
him_down
lengthwise_along
the_line
of_the
equator;_yea,
ye_gods!
go_down
to_the
fiery_pit
itself,_in
order_to
keep_out
this_frost?
_Now,
that_Lazarus
should_lie
stranded_there
on_the
curbstone_before
the_door
of_Dives,
this_is
more_wonderful
than_that
an_iceberg
should_be
moored_to
one_of
the_Moluccas.
_Yet
Dives_himself,
he_too
lives_like
a_Czar
in_an
ice_palace
made_of
frozen_sighs,
and_being
a_president
of_a
temperance_society,
he_only
drinks_the
tepid_tears
of_orphans.
_But
no_more
of_this
blubbering_now,
we_are
going_a-whaling,
and_there
is_plenty
of_that
yet_to
come._
Let_us
scrape_the
ice_from
our_frosted
feet,_and
see_what
sort_of
a_place
this_"Spouter"
may_be.
_
_CHAPTER
3_
The_Spouter-Inn.
_
Entering_that
gable-ended_Spouter-Inn,
you_found
yourself_in
a_wide,
low,_straggling
entry_with
old-fashioned_wainscots,
reminding_one
of_the
bulwarks_of
some_condemned
old_craft.
_On
one_side
hung_a
very_large
oilpainting_so
thoroughly_besmoked,
and_every
way_defaced,
that_in
the_unequal
crosslights_by
which_you
viewed_it,
it_was
only_by
diligent_study
and_a
series_of
systematic_visits
to_it,
and_careful
inquiry_of
the_neighbors,
that_you
could_any
way_arrive
at_an
understanding_of
its_purpose.
_Such
unaccountable_masses
of_shades
and_shadows,
that_at
first_you
almost_thought
some_ambitious
young_artist,
in_the
time_of
the_New
England_hags,
had_endeavored
to_delineate
chaos_bewitched.
_But
by_dint
of_much
and_earnest
contemplation,_and
oft_repeated
ponderings,_and
especially_by
throwing_open
the_little
window_towards
the_back
of_the
entry,_you
at_last
come_to
the_conclusion
that_such
an_idea,
however_wild,
might_not
be_altogether
unwarranted._
But_what
most_puzzled
and_confounded
you_was
a_long,
limber,_portentous,
black_mass
of_something
hovering_in
the_centre
of_the
picture_over
three_blue,
dim,_perpendicular
lines_floating
in_a
nameless_yeast.
_A
boggy,_soggy,
squitchy_picture
truly,_enough
to_drive
a_nervous
man_distracted.
_Yet
was_there
a_sort
of_indefinite,
half-attained,_unimaginable
sublimity_about
it_that
fairly_froze
you_to
it,_till
you_involuntarily
took_an
oath_with
yourself_to
find_out
what_that
marvellous_painting
meant._
Ever_and
anon_a
bright,_but,
alas,_deceptive
idea_would
dart_you
through.--It's_the
Black_Sea
in_a
midnight_gale.--It's
the_unnatural
combat_of
the_four
primal_elements.--It's
a_blasted
heath.--It's_a
Hyperborean_winter
scene.--It's_the
breaking-up_of
the_icebound
stream_of
Time._
But_at
last_all
these_fancies
yielded_to
that_one
portentous_something
in_the
picture's_midst.
_THAT
once_found
out,_and
all_the
rest_were
plain._
But_stop;
does_it
not_bear
a_faint
resemblance_to
a_gigantic
fish?_even
the_great
leviathan_himself?
_In
fact,_the
artist's_design
seemed_this:
a_final
theory_of
my_own,
partly_based
upon_the
aggregated_opinions
of_many
aged_persons
with_whom
I_conversed
upon_the
subject._
The_picture
represents_a
Cape-Horner_in
a_great
hurricane;_the
half-foundered_ship
weltering_there
with_its
three_dismantled
masts_alone
visible;_and
an_exasperated
whale,_purposing
to_spring
clean_over
the_craft,
is_in
the_enormous
act_of
impaling_himself
upon_the
three_mast-heads.
_The
opposite_wall
of_this
entry_was
hung_all
over_with
a_heathenish
array_of
monstrous_clubs
and_spears.
_Some
were_thickly
set_with
glittering_teeth
resembling_ivory
saws;_others
were_tufted
with_knots
of_human
hair;_and
one_was
sickle-shaped,_with
a_vast
handle_sweeping
round_like
the_segment
made_in
the_new-mown
grass_by
a_long-armed
mower._
You_shuddered
as_you
gazed,_and
wondered_what
monstrous_cannibal
and_savage
could_ever
have_gone
a_death-harvesting
with_such
a_hacking,
horrifying_implement.
_Mixed
with_these
were_rusty
old_whaling
lances_and
harpoons_all
broken_and
deformed._
Some_were
storied_weapons.
_With
this_once
long_lance,
now_wildly
elbowed,_fifty
years_ago
did_Nathan
Swain_kill
fifteen_whales
between_a
sunrise_and
a_sunset.
_And
that_harpoon--so
like_a
corkscrew_now--was
flung_in
Javan_seas,
and_run
away_with
by_a
whale,_years
afterwards_slain
off_the
Cape_of
Blanco._
The_original
iron_entered
nigh_the
tail,_and,
like_a
restless_needle
sojourning_in
the_body
of_a
man,_travelled
full_forty
feet,_and
at_last
was_found
imbedded_in
the_hump.
_Crossing
this_dusky
entry,_and
on_through
yon_low-arched
way--cut_through
what_in
old_times
must_have
been_a
great_central
chimney_with
fireplaces_all
round--you_enter
the_public
room._
A_still
duskier_place
is_this,
with_such
low_ponderous
beams_above,
and_such
old_wrinkled
planks_beneath,
that_you
would_almost
fancy_you
trod_some
old_craft's
cockpits,_especially
of_such
a_howling
night,_when
this_corner-anchored
old_ark
rocked_so
furiously._
On_one
side_stood
a_long,
low,_shelf-like
table_covered
with_cracked
glass_cases,
filled_with
dusty_rarities
gathered_from
this_wide
world's_remotest
nooks._Projecting
from_the
further_angle
of_the
room_stands
a_dark-looking
den--the_bar--a
rude_attempt
at_a
right_whale's
head._
Be_that
how_it
may,_there
stands_the
vast_arched
bone_of
the_whale's
jaw,_so
wide,_a
coach_might
almost_drive
beneath_it.
_Within
are_shabby
shelves,_ranged
round_with
old_decanters,
bottles,_flasks;
and_in
those_jaws
of_swift
destruction,_like
another_cursed
Jonah_(by
which_name
indeed_they
called_him),
bustles_a
little_withered
old_man,
who,_for
their_money,
dearly_sells
the_sailors
deliriums_and
death._
Abominable_are
the_tumblers
into_which
he_pours
his_poison.
_Though
true_cylinders
without--within,_the
villanous_green
goggling_glasses
deceitfully_tapered
downwards_to
a_cheating
bottom._
Parallel_meridians
rudely_pecked
into_the
glass,_surround
these_footpads'
goblets._
Fill_to
THIS_mark,
and_your
charge_is
but_a
penny;_to
THIS_a
penny_more;
and_so
on_to
the_full
glass--the_Cape
Horn_measure,
which_you
may_gulp
down_for
a_shilling.
_Upon
entering_the
place_I
found_a
number_of
young_seamen
gathered_about
a_table,
examining_by
a_dim
light_divers
specimens_of
SKRIMSHANDER._
I_sought
the_landlord,
and_telling
him_I
desired_to
be_accommodated
with_a
room,_received
for_answer
that_his
house_was
full--not_a
bed_unoccupied.
_"But
avast,"_he
added,_tapping
his_forehead,
"you_haint
no_objections
to_sharing
a_harpooneer's
blanket,_have
ye?_
I_s'pose
you_are
goin'_a-whalin',
so_you'd
better_get
used_to
that_sort
of_thing."
_I
told_him
that_I
never_liked
to_sleep
two_in
a_bed;
that_if
I_should
ever_do
so,_it
would_depend
upon_who
the_harpooneer
might_be,
and_that
if_he
(the_landlord)
really_had
no_other
place_for
me,_and
the_harpooneer
was_not
decidedly_objectionable,
why_rather
than_wander
further_about
a_strange
town_on
so_bitter
a_night,
I_would
put_up
with_the
half_of
any_decent
man's_blanket.
_"I
thought_so.
_All
right;_take
a_seat.
_Supper?--you
want_supper?
Supper'll_be
ready_directly."
_I
sat_down
on_an
old_wooden
settle,_carved
all_over
like_a
bench_on
the_Battery.
_At
one_end
a_ruminating
tar_was
still_further
adorning_it
with_his
jack-knife,_stooping
over_and
diligently_working
away_at
the_space
between_his
legs._
He_was
trying_his
hand_at
a_ship
under_full
sail,_but
he_didn't
make_much
headway,_I
thought._
At_last
some_four
or_five
of_us
were_summoned
to_our
meal_in
an_adjoining
room._
It_was
cold_as
Iceland--no_fire
at_all--the
landlord_said
he_couldn't
afford_it.
_Nothing
but_two
dismal_tallow
candles,_each
in_a
winding_sheet.
_We
were_fain
to_button
up_our
monkey_jackets,
and_hold
to_our
lips_cups
of_scalding
tea_with
our_half
frozen_fingers.
_But
the_fare
was_of
the_most
substantial_kind--not
only_meat
and_potatoes,
but_dumplings;
good_heavens!
dumplings_for
supper!_
One_young
fellow_in
a_green
box_coat,
addressed_himself
to_these
dumplings_in
a_most
direful_manner.
_"My
boy,"_said
the_landlord,
"you'll_have
the_nightmare
to_a
dead_sartainty."
_"Landlord,"
I_whispered,
"that_aint
the_harpooneer
is_it?"
_"Oh,
no,"_said
he,_looking
a_sort
of_diabolically
funny,_"the
harpooneer_is
a_dark
complexioned_chap.
_He
never_eats
dumplings,_he
don't--he_eats
nothing_but
steaks,_and
he_likes
'em_rare."
_"The
devil_he
does,"_says
I._
"Where_is
that_harpooneer?
_Is
he_here?"
_"He'll
be_here
afore_long,"
was_the
answer._
I_could
not_help
it,_but
I_began
to_feel
suspicious_of
this_"dark
complexioned"_harpooneer.
_At
any_rate,
I_made
up_my
mind_that
if_it
so_turned
out_that
we_should
sleep_together,
he_must
undress_and
get_into
bed_before
I_did.
_Supper
over,_the
company_went
back_to
the_bar-room,
when,_knowing
not_what
else_to
do_with
myself,_I
resolved_to
spend_the
rest_of
the_evening
as_a
looker_on.
_Presently
a_rioting
noise_was
heard_without.
_Starting
up,_the
landlord_cried,
"That's_the
Grampus's_crew.
_I
seed_her
reported_in
the_offing
this_morning;
a_three
years'_voyage,
and_a
full_ship.
Hurrah,_boys;
now_we'll
have_the
latest_news
from_the
Feegees."_
A_tramping
of_sea
boots_was
heard_in
the_entry;
the_door
was_flung
open,_and
in_rolled
a_wild
set_of
mariners_enough.
_Enveloped
in_their
shaggy_watch
coats,_and
with_their
heads_muffled
in_woollen
comforters,_all
bedarned_and
ragged,_and
their_beards
stiff_with
icicles,_they
seemed_an
eruption_of
bears_from
Labrador._
They_had
just_landed
from_their
boat,_and
this_was
the_first
house_they
entered._
No_wonder,
then,_that
they_made
a_straight
wake_for
the_whale's
mouth--the_bar--when
the_wrinkled
little_old
Jonah,_there
officiating,_soon
poured_them
out_brimmers
all_round.
_One
complained_of
a_bad
cold_in
his_head,
upon_which
Jonah_mixed
him_a
pitch-like_potion
of_gin
and_molasses,
which_he
swore_was
a_sovereign
cure_for
all_colds
and_catarrhs
whatsoever,_never
mind_of
how_long
standing,_or
whether_caught
off_the
coast_of
Labrador,_or
on_the
weather_side
of_an
ice-island._
The_liquor
soon_mounted
into_their
heads,_as
it_generally
does_even
with_the
arrantest_topers
newly_landed
from_sea,
and_they
began_capering
about_most
obstreperously._
I_observed,
however,_that
one_of
them_held
somewhat_aloof,
and_though
he_seemed
desirous_not
to_spoil
the_hilarity
of_his
shipmates_by
his_own
sober_face,
yet_upon
the_whole
he_refrained
from_making
as_much
noise_as
the_rest.
_This
man_interested
me_at
once;_and
since_the
sea-gods_had
ordained_that
he_should
soon_become
my_shipmate
(though_but
a_sleeping-partner
one,_so
far_as
this_narrative
is_concerned),
I_will
here_venture
upon_a
little_description
of_him.
_He
stood_full
six_feet
in_height,
with_noble
shoulders,_and
a_chest
like_a
coffer-dam._
I_have
seldom_seen
such_brawn
in_a
man._
His_face
was_deeply
brown_and
burnt,_making
his_white
teeth_dazzling
by_the
contrast;_while
in_the
deep_shadows
of_his
eyes_floated
some_reminiscences
that_did
not_seem
to_give
him_much
joy._
His_voice
at_once
announced_that
he_was
a_Southerner,
and_from
his_fine
stature,_I
thought_he
must_be
one_of
those_tall
mountaineers_from
the_Alleghanian
Ridge_in
Virginia._
When_the
revelry_of
his_companions
had_mounted
to_its
height,_this
man_slipped
away_unobserved,
and_I
saw_no
more_of
him_till
he_became
my_comrade
on_the
sea._
In_a
few_minutes,
however,_he
was_missed
by_his
shipmates,_and
being,_it
seems,_for
some_reason
a_huge
favourite_with
them,_they
raised_a
cry_of
"Bulkington!_
Bulkington!_where's
Bulkington?"_and
darted_out
of_the
house_in
pursuit_of
him._
It_was
now_about
nine_o'clock,
and_the
room_seeming
almost_supernaturally
quiet_after
these_orgies,
I_began
to_congratulate
myself_upon
a_little
plan_that
had_occurred
to_me
just_previous
to_the
entrance_of
the_seamen.
_No
man_prefers
to_sleep
two_in
a_bed.
_In
fact,_you
would_a
good_deal
rather_not
sleep_with
your_own
brother._
I_don't
know_how
it_is,
but_people
like_to
be_private
when_they
are_sleeping.
_And
when_it
comes_to
sleeping_with
an_unknown
stranger,_in
a_strange
inn,_in
a_strange
town,_and
that_stranger
a_harpooneer,
then_your
objections_indefinitely
multiply._
Nor_was
there_any
earthly_reason
why_I
as_a
sailor_should
sleep_two
in_a
bed,_more
than_anybody
else;_for
sailors_no
more_sleep
two_in
a_bed
at_sea,
than_bachelor
Kings_do
ashore._
To_be
sure_they
all_sleep
together_in
one_apartment,
but_you
have_your
own_hammock,
and_cover
yourself_with
your_own
blanket,_and
sleep_in
your_own
skin._
The_more
I_pondered
over_this
harpooneer,_the
more_I
abominated_the
thought_of
sleeping_with
him._
It_was
fair_to
presume_that
being_a
harpooneer,_his
linen_or
woollen,_as
the_case
might_be,
would_not
be_of
the_tidiest,
certainly_none
of_the
finest._
I_began
to_twitch
all_over.
_Besides,
it_was
getting_late,
and_my
decent_harpooneer
ought_to
be_home
and_going
bedwards._
Suppose_now,
he_should
tumble_in
upon_me
at_midnight--how
could_I
tell_from
what_vile
hole_he
had_been
coming?_
"Landlord!_
I've_changed
my_mind
about_that
harpooneer.--I_shan't
sleep_with
him._
I'll_try
the_bench
here."_
"Just_as
you_please;
I'm_sorry
I_cant
spare_ye
a_tablecloth
for_a
mattress,_and
it's_a
plaguy_rough
board_here"--feeling
of_the
knots_and
notches._
"But_wait
a_bit,
Skrimshander;_I've
got_a
carpenter's_plane
there_in
the_bar--wait,
I_say,
and_I'll
make_ye
snug_enough."
So_saying
he_procured
the_plane;
and_with
his_old
silk_handkerchief
first_dusting
the_bench,
vigorously_set
to_planing
away_at
my_bed,
the_while
grinning_like
an_ape.
_The
shavings_flew
right_and
left;_till
at_last
the_plane-iron
came_bump
against_an
indestructible_knot.
The_landlord
was_near
spraining_his
wrist,_and
I_told
him_for
heaven's_sake
to_quit--the
bed_was
soft_enough
to_suit
me,_and
I_did
not_know
how_all
the_planing
in_the
world_could
make_eider
down_of
a_pine
plank._
So_gathering
up_the
shavings_with
another_grin,
and_throwing
them_into
the_great
stove_in
the_middle
of_the
room,_he
went_about
his_business,
and_left
me_in
a_brown
study._
I_now
took_the
measure_of
the_bench,
and_found
that_it
was_a
foot_too
short;_but
that_could
be_mended
with_a
chair._
But_it
was_a
foot_too
narrow,_and
the_other
bench_in
the_room
was_about
four_inches
higher_than
the_planed
one--so_there
was_no
yoking_them.
_I
then_placed
the_first
bench_lengthwise
along_the
only_clear
space_against
the_wall,
leaving_a
little_interval
between,_for
my_back
to_settle
down_in.
But_I
soon_found
that_there
came_such
a_draught
of_cold
air_over
me_from
under_the
sill_of
the_window,
that_this
plan_would
never_do
at_all,
especially_as
another_current
from_the
rickety_door
met_the
one_from
the_window,
and_both
together_formed
a_series
of_small
whirlwinds_in
the_immediate
vicinity_of
the_spot
where_I
had_thought
to_spend
the_night.
_The
devil_fetch
that_harpooneer,
thought_I,
but_stop,
couldn't_I
steal_a
march_on
him--bolt_his
door_inside,
and_jump
into_his
bed,_not
to_be
wakened_by
the_most
violent_knockings?
_It
seemed_no
bad_idea;
but_upon
second_thoughts
I_dismissed
it._
For_who
could_tell
but_what
the_next
morning,_so
soon_as
I_popped
out_of
the_room,
the_harpooneer
might_be
standing_in
the_entry,
all_ready
to_knock
me_down!
_Still,
looking_round
me_again,
and_seeing
no_possible
chance_of
spending_a
sufferable_night
unless_in
some_other
person's_bed,
I_began
to_think
that_after
all_I
might_be
cherishing_unwarrantable
prejudices_against
this_unknown
harpooneer._
Thinks_I,
I'll_wait
awhile;_he
must_be
dropping_in
before_long.
_I'll
have_a
good_look
at_him
then,_and
perhaps_we
may_become
jolly_good
bedfellows_after
all--there's_no
telling._
But_though
the_other
boarders_kept
coming_in
by_ones,
twos,_and
threes,_and
going_to
bed,_yet
no_sign
of_my
harpooneer._
"Landlord!_said
I,_"what
sort_of
a_chap
is_he--does
he_always
keep_such
late_hours?"
_It
was_now
hard_upon
twelve_o'clock.
_The
landlord_chuckled
again_with
his_lean
chuckle,_and
seemed_to
be_mightily
tickled_at
something_beyond
my_comprehension.
_"No,"
he_answered,
"generally_he's
an_early
bird--airley_to
bed_and
airley_to
rise--yes,_he's
the_bird
what_catches
the_worm.
_But
to-night_he
went_out
a_peddling,
you_see,
and_I
don't_see
what_on
airth_keeps
him_so
late,_unless,
may_be,
he_can't
sell_his
head."_
"Can't_sell
his_head?--What
sort_of
a_bamboozingly
story_is
this_you
are_telling
me?"_getting
into_a
towering_rage.
_"Do
you_pretend
to_say,
landlord,_that
this_harpooneer
is_actually
engaged_this
blessed_Saturday
night,_or
rather_Sunday
morning,_in
peddling_his
head_around
this_town?"
_"That's
precisely_it,"
said_the
landlord,_"and
I_told
him_he
couldn't_sell
it_here,
the_market's
overstocked."_
"With_what?"
shouted_I.
_"With
heads_to
be_sure;
ain't_there
too_many
heads_in
the_world?"
_"I
tell_you
what_it
is,_landlord,"
said_I
quite_calmly,
"you'd_better
stop_spinning
that_yarn
to_me--I'm
not_green."
_"May
be_not,"
taking_out
a_stick
and_whittling
a_toothpick,
"but_I
rayther_guess
you'll_be
done_BROWN
if_that
ere_harpooneer
hears_you
a_slanderin'
his_head."
_"I'll
break_it
for_him,"
said_I,
now_flying
into_a
passion_again
at_this
unaccountable_farrago
of_the
landlord's._
"It's_broke
a'ready,"_said
he._
"Broke,"_said
I--"BROKE,_do
you_mean?"
_"Sartain,
and_that's
the_very
reason_he
can't_sell
it,_I
guess."_
"Landlord,"_said
I,_going
up_to
him_as
cool_as
Mt._Hecla
in_a
snow-storm--"landlord,_stop
whittling._
You_and
I_must
understand_one
another,_and
that_too
without_delay.
_I
come_to
your_house
and_want
a_bed;
you_tell
me_you
can_only
give_me
half_a
one;_that
the_other
half_belongs
to_a
certain_harpooneer.
_And
about_this
harpooneer,_whom
I_have
not_yet
seen,_you
persist_in
telling_me
the_most
mystifying_and
exasperating_stories
tending_to
beget_in
me_an
uncomfortable_feeling
towards_the
man_whom
you_design
for_my
bedfellow--a_sort
of_connexion,
landlord,_which
is_an
intimate_and
confidential_one
in_the
highest_degree.
_I
now_demand
of_you
to_speak
out_and
tell_me
who_and
what_this
harpooneer_is,
and_whether
I_shall
be_in
all_respects
safe_to
spend_the
night_with
him._
And_in
the_first
place,_you
will_be
so_good
as_to
unsay_that
story_about
selling_his
head,_which
if_true
I_take
to_be
good_evidence
that_this
harpooneer_is
stark_mad,
and_I've
no_idea
of_sleeping
with_a
madman;_and
you,_sir,
YOU_I
mean,_landlord,
YOU,_sir,
by_trying
to_induce
me_to
do_so
knowingly,_would
thereby_render
yourself_liable
to_a
criminal_prosecution."
_"Wall,"
said_the
landlord,_fetching
a_long
breath,_"that's
a_purty
long_sarmon
for_a
chap_that
rips_a
little_now
and_then.
_But
be_easy,
be_easy,
this_here
harpooneer_I
have_been
tellin'_you
of_has
just_arrived
from_the
south_seas,
where_he
bought_up
a_lot
of_'balmed
New_Zealand
heads_(great
curios,_you
know),_and
he's_sold
all_on
'em_but
one,_and
that_one
he's_trying
to_sell
to-night,_cause
to-morrow's_Sunday,
and_it
would_not
do_to
be_sellin'
human_heads
about_the
streets_when
folks_is
goin'_to
churches._
He_wanted
to,_last
Sunday,_but
I_stopped
him_just
as_he
was_goin'
out_of
the_door
with_four
heads_strung
on_a
string,_for
all_the
airth_like
a_string
of_inions."
_This
account_cleared
up_the
otherwise_unaccountable
mystery,_and
showed_that
the_landlord,
after_all,
had_had
no_idea
of_fooling
me--but_at
the_same
time_what
could_I
think_of
a_harpooneer
who_stayed
out_of
a_Saturday
night_clean
into_the
holy_Sabbath,
engaged_in
such_a
cannibal_business
as_selling
the_heads
of_dead
idolators?_
"Depend_upon
it,_landlord,
that_harpooneer
is_a
dangerous_man."
_"He
pays_reg'lar,"
was_the
rejoinder._
"But_come,
it's_getting
dreadful_late,
you_had
better_be
turning_flukes--it's
a_nice
bed;_Sal
and_me
slept_in
that_ere
bed_the
night_we
were_spliced.
_There's
plenty_of
room_for
two_to
kick_about
in_that
bed;_it's
an_almighty
big_bed
that._
Why,_afore
we_give
it_up,
Sal_used
to_put
our_Sam
and_little
Johnny_in
the_foot
of_it.
_But
I_got
a_dreaming
and_sprawling
about_one
night,_and
somehow,_Sam
got_pitched
on_the
floor,_and
came_near
breaking_his
arm._
Arter_that,
Sal_said
it_wouldn't
do._
Come_along
here,_I'll
give_ye
a_glim
in_a
jiffy;"_and
so_saying
he_lighted
a_candle
and_held
it_towards
me,_offering
to_lead
the_way.
_But
I_stood
irresolute;_when
looking_at
a_clock
in_the
corner,_he
exclaimed_"I
vum_it's
Sunday--you_won't
see_that
harpooneer_to-night;
he's_come
to_anchor
somewhere--come_along
then;_DO
come;_WON'T
ye_come?"
_I
considered_the
matter_a
moment,_and
then_up
stairs_we
went,_and
I_was
ushered_into
a_small
room,_cold
as_a
clam,_and
furnished,_sure
enough,_with
a_prodigious
bed,_almost
big_enough
indeed_for
any_four
harpooneers_to
sleep_abreast.
_"There,"
said_the
landlord,_placing
the_candle
on_a
crazy_old
sea_chest
that_did
double_duty
as_a
wash-stand_and
centre_table;
"there,_make
yourself_comfortable
now,_and
good_night
to_ye."
_I
turned_round
from_eyeing
the_bed,
but_he
had_disappeared.
_Folding
back_the
counterpane,_I
stooped_over
the_bed.
_Though
none_of
the_most
elegant,_it
yet_stood
the_scrutiny
tolerably_well.
_I
then_glanced
round_the
room;_and
besides_the
bedstead_and
centre_table,
could_see
no_other
furniture_belonging
to_the
place,_but
a_rude
shelf,_the
four_walls,
and_a
papered_fireboard
representing_a
man_striking
a_whale.
_Of
things_not
properly_belonging
to_the
room,_there
was_a
hammock_lashed
up,_and
thrown_upon
the_floor
in_one
corner;_also
a_large
seaman's_bag,
containing_the
harpooneer's_wardrobe,
no_doubt
in_lieu
of_a
land_trunk.
_Likewise,
there_was
a_parcel
of_outlandish
bone_fish
hooks_on
the_shelf
over_the
fire-place,_and
a_tall
harpoon_standing
at_the
head_of
the_bed.
_But
what_is
this_on
the_chest?
_I
took_it
up,_and
held_it
close_to
the_light,
and_felt
it,_and
smelt_it,
and_tried
every_way
possible_to
arrive_at
some_satisfactory
conclusion_concerning
it._
I_can
compare_it
to_nothing
but_a
large_door
mat,_ornamented
at_the
edges_with
little_tinkling
tags_something
like_the
stained_porcupine
quills_round
an_Indian
moccasin._
There_was
a_hole
or_slit
in_the
middle_of
this_mat,
as_you
see_the
same_in
South_American
ponchos._
But_could
it_be
possible_that
any_sober
harpooneer_would
get_into
a_door
mat,_and
parade_the
streets_of
any_Christian
town_in
that_sort
of_guise?
I_put
it_on,
to_try
it,_and
it_weighed
me_down
like_a
hamper,_being
uncommonly_shaggy
and_thick,
and_I
thought_a
little_damp,
as_though
this_mysterious
harpooneer_had
been_wearing
it_of
a_rainy
day._
I_went
up_in
it_to
a_bit
of_glass
stuck_against
the_wall,
and_I
never_saw
such_a
sight_in
my_life.
_I
tore_myself
out_of
it_in
such_a
hurry_that
I_gave
myself_a
kink_in
the_neck.
_I
sat_down
on_the
side_of
the_bed,
and_commenced
thinking_about
this_head-peddling
harpooneer,_and
his_door
mat._
After_thinking
some_time
on_the
bed-side,_I
got_up
and_took
off_my
monkey_jacket,
and_then
stood_in
the_middle
of_the
room_thinking.
_I
then_took
off_my
coat,_and
thought_a
little_more
in_my
shirt_sleeves.
_But
beginning_to
feel_very
cold_now,
half_undressed
as_I
was,_and
remembering_what
the_landlord
said_about
the_harpooneer's
not_coming
home_at
all_that
night,_it
being_so
very_late,
I_made
no_more
ado,_but
jumped_out
of_my
pantaloons_and
boots,_and
then_blowing
out_the
light_tumbled
into_bed,
and_commended
myself_to
the_care
of_heaven.
_Whether
that_mattress
was_stuffed
with_corn-cobs
or_broken
crockery,_there
is_no
telling,_but
I_rolled
about_a
good_deal,
and_could
not_sleep
for_a
long_time.
_At
last_I
slid_off
into_a
light_doze,
and_had
pretty_nearly
made_a
good_offing
towards_the
land_of
Nod,_when
I_heard
a_heavy
footfall_in
the_passage,
and_saw
a_glimmer
of_light
come_into
the_room
from_under
the_door.
_Lord
save_me,
thinks_I,
that_must
be_the
harpooneer,_the
infernal_head-peddler.
_But
I_lay
perfectly_still,
and_resolved
not_to
say_a
word_till
spoken_to.
_Holding
a_light
in_one
hand,_and
that_identical
New_Zealand
head_in
the_other,
the_stranger
entered_the
room,_and
without_looking
towards_the
bed,_placed
his_candle
a_good
way_off
from_me
on_the
floor_in
one_corner,
and_then
began_working
away_at
the_knotted
cords_of
the_large
bag_I
before_spoke
of_as
being_in
the_room.
_I
was_all
eagerness_to
see_his
face,_but
he_kept
it_averted
for_some
time_while
employed_in
unlacing_the
bag's_mouth.
_This
accomplished,_however,
he_turned
round--when,_good
heavens!_what
a_sight!
_Such
a_face!
_It
was_of
a_dark,
purplish,_yellow
colour,_here
and_there
stuck_over
with_large
blackish_looking
squares._
Yes,_it's
just_as
I_thought,
he's_a
terrible_bedfellow;
he's_been
in_a
fight,_got
dreadfully_cut,
and_here
he_is,
just_from
the_surgeon.
_But
at_that
moment_he
chanced_to
turn_his
face_so
towards_the
light,_that
I_plainly
saw_they
could_not
be_sticking-plasters
at_all,
those_black
squares_on
his_cheeks.
_They
were_stains
of_some
sort_or
other._
At_first
I_knew
not_what
to_make
of_this;
but_soon
an_inkling
of_the
truth_occurred
to_me.
_I
remembered_a
story_of
a_white
man--a_whaleman
too--who,_falling
among_the
cannibals,_had
been_tattooed
by_them.
_I
concluded_that
this_harpooneer,
in_the
course_of
his_distant
voyages,_must
have_met
with_a
similar_adventure.
_And
what_is
it,_thought
I,_after
all!_
It's_only
his_outside;
a_man
can_be
honest_in
any_sort
of_skin.
_But
then,_what
to_make
of_his
unearthly_complexion,
that_part
of_it,
I_mean,
lying_round
about,_and
completely_independent
of_the
squares_of
tattooing._
To_be
sure,_it
might_be
nothing_but
a_good
coat_of
tropical_tanning;
but_I
never_heard
of_a
hot_sun's
tanning_a
white_man
into_a
purplish_yellow
one._However,
I_had
never_been
in_the
South_Seas;
and_perhaps
the_sun
there_produced
these_extraordinary
effects_upon
the_skin.
_Now,
while_all
these_ideas
were_passing
through_me
like_lightning,
this_harpooneer
never_noticed
me_at
all._
But,_after
some_difficulty
having_opened
his_bag,
he_commenced
fumbling_in
it,_and
presently_pulled
out_a
sort_of
tomahawk,_and
a_seal-skin
wallet_with
the_hair
on._
Placing_these
on_the
old_chest
in_the
middle_of
the_room,
he_then
took_the
New_Zealand
head--a_ghastly
thing_enough--and
crammed_it
down_into
the_bag.
_He
now_took
off_his
hat--a_new
beaver_hat--when
I_came
nigh_singing
out_with
fresh_surprise.
_There
was_no
hair_on
his_head--none
to_speak
of_at
least--nothing_but
a_small
scalp-knot_twisted
up_on
his_forehead.
_His
bald_purplish
head_now
looked_for
all_the
world_like
a_mildewed
skull._
Had_not
the_stranger
stood_between
me_and
the_door,
I_would
have_bolted
out_of
it_quicker
than_ever
I_bolted
a_dinner.
_Even
as_it
was,_I
thought_something
of_slipping
out_of
the_window,
but_it
was_the
second_floor
back._
I_am
no_coward,
but_what
to_make
of_this
head-peddling_purple
rascal_altogether
passed_my
comprehension._
Ignorance_is
the_parent
of_fear,
and_being
completely_nonplussed
and_confounded
about_the
stranger,_I
confess_I
was_now
as_much
afraid_of
him_as
if_it
was_the
devil_himself
who_had
thus_broken
into_my
room_at
the_dead
of_night.
_In
fact,_I
was_so
afraid_of
him_that
I_was
not_game
enough_just
then_to
address_him,
and_demand
a_satisfactory
answer_concerning
what_seemed
inexplicable_in
him._
Meanwhile,_he
continued_the
business_of
undressing,_and
at_last
showed_his
chest_and
arms._
As_I
live,_these
covered_parts
of_him
were_checkered
with_the
same_squares
as_his
face;_his
back,_too,
was_all
over_the
same_dark
squares;_he
seemed_to
have_been
in_a
Thirty_Years'
War,_and
just_escaped
from_it
with_a
sticking-plaster_shirt.
Still_more,
his_very
legs_were
marked,_as
if_a
parcel_of
dark_green
frogs_were
running_up
the_trunks
of_young
palms._
It_was
now_quite
plain_that
he_must
be_some
abominable_savage
or_other
shipped_aboard
of_a
whaleman_in
the_South
Seas,_and
so_landed
in_this
Christian_country.
_I
quaked_to
think_of
it._
A_peddler
of_heads
too--perhaps_the
heads_of
his_own
brothers._
He_might
take_a
fancy_to
mine--heavens!_look
at_that
tomahawk!_
But_there
was_no
time_for
shuddering,_for
now_the
savage_went
about_something
that_completely
fascinated_my
attention,_and
convinced_me
that_he
must_indeed
be_a
heathen._
Going_to
his_heavy
grego,_or
wrapall,_or
dreadnaught,_which
he_had
previously_hung
on_a
chair,_he
fumbled_in
the_pockets,
and_produced
at_length
a_curious
little_deformed
image_with
a_hunch
on_its
back,_and
exactly_the
colour_of
a_three
days'_old
Congo_baby.
_Remembering
the_embalmed
head,_at
first_I
almost_thought
that_this
black_manikin
was_a
real_baby
preserved_in
some_similar
manner._
But_seeing
that_it
was_not
at_all
limber,_and
that_it
glistened_a
good_deal
like_polished
ebony,_I
concluded_that
it_must
be_nothing
but_a
wooden_idol,
which_indeed
it_proved
to_be.
_For
now_the
savage_goes
up_to
the_empty
fire-place,_and
removing_the
papered_fire-board,
sets_up
this_little
hunch-backed_image,
like_a
tenpin,_between
the_andirons.
_The
chimney_jambs
and_all
the_bricks
inside_were
very_sooty,
so_that
I_thought
this_fire-place
made_a
very_appropriate
little_shrine
or_chapel
for_his
Congo_idol.
_I
now_screwed
my_eyes
hard_towards
the_half
hidden_image,
feeling_but
ill_at
ease_meantime--to
see_what
was_next
to_follow.
_First
he_takes
about_a
double_handful
of_shavings
out_of
his_grego
pocket,_and
places_them
carefully_before
the_idol;
then_laying
a_bit
of_ship
biscuit_on
top_and
applying_the
flame_from
the_lamp,
he_kindled
the_shavings
into_a
sacrificial_blaze.
_Presently,
after_many
hasty_snatches
into_the
fire,_and
still_hastier
withdrawals_of
his_fingers
(whereby_he
seemed_to
be_scorching
them_badly),
he_at
last_succeeded
in_drawing
out_the
biscuit;_then
blowing_off
the_heat
and_ashes
a_little,
he_made
a_polite
offer_of
it_to
the_little
negro._
But_the
little_devil
did_not
seem_to
fancy_such
dry_sort
of_fare
at_all;
he_never
moved_his
lips._
All_these
strange_antics
were_accompanied
by_still
stranger_guttural
noises_from
the_devotee,
who_seemed
to_be
praying_in
a_sing-song
or_else
singing_some
pagan_psalmody
or_other,
during_which
his_face
twitched_about
in_the
most_unnatural
manner._At
last_extinguishing
the_fire,
he_took
the_idol
up_very
unceremoniously,_and
bagged_it
again_in
his_grego
pocket_as
carelessly_as
if_he
were_a
sportsman_bagging
a_dead
woodcock._
All_these
queer_proceedings
increased_my
uncomfortableness,_and
seeing_him
now_exhibiting
strong_symptoms
of_concluding
his_business
operations,_and
jumping_into
bed_with
me,_I
thought_it
was_high
time,_now
or_never,
before_the
light_was
put_out,
to_break
the_spell
in_which
I_had
so_long
been_bound.
_But
the_interval
I_spent
in_deliberating
what_to
say,_was
a_fatal
one._
Taking_up
his_tomahawk
from_the
table,_he
examined_the
head_of
it_for
an_instant,
and_then
holding_it
to_the
light,_with
his_mouth
at_the
handle,_he
puffed_out
great_clouds
of_tobacco
smoke._
The_next
moment_the
light_was
extinguished,_and
this_wild
cannibal,_tomahawk
between_his
teeth,_sprang
into_bed
with_me.
_I
sang_out,
I_could
not_help
it_now;
and_giving
a_sudden
grunt_of
astonishment_he
began_feeling
me._
Stammering_out
something,_I
knew_not
what,_I
rolled_away
from_him
against_the
wall,_and
then_conjured
him,_whoever
or_whatever
he_might
be,_to
keep_quiet,
and_let
me_get
up_and
light_the
lamp_again.
_But
his_guttural
responses_satisfied
me_at
once_that
he_but
ill_comprehended
my_meaning.
_"Who-e
debel_you?"--he
at_last
said--"you_no
speak-e,_dam-me,
I_kill-e."
_And
so_saying
the_lighted
tomahawk_began
flourishing_about
me_in
the_dark.
_"Landlord,
for_God's
sake,_Peter
Coffin!"_shouted
I._
"Landlord!_Watch!
_Coffin!
_Angels!
save_me!"
_"Speak-e!
tell-ee_me
who-ee_be,
or_dam-me,
I_kill-e!"
again_growled
the_cannibal,
while_his
horrid_flourishings
of_the
tomahawk_scattered
the_hot
tobacco_ashes
about_me
till_I
thought_my
linen_would
get_on
fire._
But_thank
heaven,_at
that_moment
the_landlord
came_into
the_room
light_in
hand,_and
leaping_from
the_bed
I_ran
up_to
him._
"Don't_be
afraid_now,"
said_he,
grinning_again,
"Queequeg_here
wouldn't_harm
a_hair
of_your
head."_
"Stop_your
grinning,"_shouted
I,_"and
why_didn't
you_tell
me_that
that_infernal
harpooneer_was
a_cannibal?"
_"I
thought_ye
know'd_it;--didn't
I_tell
ye,_he
was_a
peddlin'_heads
around_town?--but
turn_flukes
again_and
go_to
sleep._
Queequeg,_look
here--you_sabbee
me,_I
sabbee--you_this
man_sleepe
you--you_sabbee?"
_"Me
sabbee_plenty"--grunted
Queequeg,_puffing
away_at
his_pipe
and_sitting
up_in
bed._
"You_gettee
in,"_he
added,_motioning
to_me
with_his
tomahawk,_and
throwing_the
clothes_to
one_side.
_He
really_did
this_in
not_only
a_civil
but_a
really_kind
and_charitable
way._
I_stood
looking_at
him_a
moment._
For_all
his_tattooings
he_was
on_the
whole_a
clean,_comely
looking_cannibal.
_What's
all_this
fuss_I
have_been
making_about,
thought_I
to_myself--the
man's_a
human_being
just_as
I_am:
he_has
just_as
much_reason
to_fear
me,_as
I_have
to_be
afraid_of
him._Better
sleep_with
a_sober
cannibal_than
a_drunken
Christian._
"Landlord,"_said
I,_"tell
him_to
stash_his
tomahawk_there,
or_pipe,
or_whatever
you_call
it;_tell
him_to
stop_smoking,
in_short,
and_I
will_turn
in_with
him._
But_I
don't_fancy
having_a
man_smoking
in_bed
with_me.
_It's
dangerous._
Besides,_I
ain't_insured."
_This
being_told
to_Queequeg,
he_at
once_complied,
and_again
politely_motioned
me_to
get_into
bed--rolling_over
to_one
side_as
much_as
to_say--I
won't_touch
a_leg
of_ye."
_"Good
night,_landlord,"
said_I,
"you_may
go."_
I_turned
in,_and
never_slept
better_in
my_life.
_
_CHAPTER
4_
The_Counterpane.
_
Upon_waking
next_morning
about_daylight,
I_found
Queequeg's_arm
thrown_over
me_in
the_most
loving_and
affectionate_manner.
_You
had_almost
thought_I
had_been
his_wife.
_The
counterpane_was
of_patchwork,
full_of
odd_little
parti-coloured_squares
and_triangles;
and_this
arm_of
his_tattooed
all_over
with_an
interminable_Cretan
labyrinth_of
a_figure,
no_two
parts_of
which_were
of_one
precise_shade--owing
I_suppose
to_his
keeping_his
arm_at
sea_unmethodically
in_sun
and_shade,
his_shirt
sleeves_irregularly
rolled_up
at_various
times--this_same
arm_of
his,_I
say,_looked
for_all
the_world
like_a
strip_of
that_same
patchwork_quilt.
_Indeed,
partly_lying
on_it
as_the
arm_did
when_I
first_awoke,
I_could
hardly_tell
it_from
the_quilt,
they_so
blended_their
hues_together;
and_it
was_only
by_the
sense_of
weight_and
pressure_that
I_could
tell_that
Queequeg_was
hugging_me.
_My
sensations_were
strange._
Let_me
try_to
explain_them.
_When
I_was
a_child,
I_well
remember_a
somewhat_similar
circumstance_that
befell_me;
whether_it
was_a
reality_or
a_dream,
I_never
could_entirely
settle._
The_circumstance
was_this.
_I
had_been
cutting_up
some_caper
or_other--I
think_it
was_trying
to_crawl
up_the
chimney,_as
I_had
seen_a
little_sweep
do_a
few_days
previous;_and
my_stepmother
who,_somehow
or_other,
was_all
the_time
whipping_me,
or_sending
me_to
bed_supperless,--my
mother_dragged
me_by
the_legs
out_of
the_chimney
and_packed
me_off
to_bed,
though_it
was_only
two_o'clock
in_the
afternoon_of
the_21st
June,_the
longest_day
in_the
year_in
our_hemisphere.
_I
felt_dreadfully.
_But
there_was
no_help
for_it,
so_up
stairs_I
went_to
my_little
room_in
the_third
floor,_undressed
myself_as
slowly_as
possible_so
as_to
kill_time,
and_with
a_bitter
sigh_got
between_the
sheets._
I_lay
there_dismally
calculating_that
sixteen_entire
hours_must
elapse_before
I_could
hope_for
a_resurrection.
_Sixteen
hours_in
bed!_the
small_of
my_back
ached_to
think_of
it._
And_it
was_so
light_too;
the_sun
shining_in
at_the
window,_and
a_great
rattling_of
coaches_in
the_streets,
and_the
sound_of
gay_voices
all_over
the_house.
_I
felt_worse
and_worse--at
last_I
got_up,
dressed,_and
softly_going
down_in
my_stockinged
feet,_sought
out_my
stepmother,_and
suddenly_threw
myself_at
her_feet,
beseeching_her
as_a
particular_favour
to_give
me_a
good_slippering
for_my
misbehaviour;_anything
indeed_but
condemning_me
to_lie
abed_such
an_unendurable
length_of
time._
But_she
was_the
best_and
most_conscientious
of_stepmothers,
and_back
I_had
to_go
to_my
room._
For_several
hours_I
lay_there
broad_awake,
feeling_a
great_deal
worse_than
I_have
ever_done
since,_even
from_the
greatest_subsequent
misfortunes._
At_last
I_must
have_fallen
into_a
troubled_nightmare
of_a
doze;_and
slowly_waking
from_it--half
steeped_in
dreams--I_opened
my_eyes,
and_the
before_sun-lit
room_was
now_wrapped
in_outer
darkness._
Instantly_I
felt_a
shock_running
through_all
my_frame;
nothing_was
to_be
seen,_and
nothing_was
to_be
heard;_but
a_supernatural
hand_seemed
placed_in
mine._
My_arm
hung_over
the_counterpane,
and_the
nameless,_unimaginable,
silent_form
or_phantom,
to_which
the_hand
belonged,_seemed
closely_seated
by_my
bed-side._For
what_seemed
ages_piled
on_ages,
I_lay
there,_frozen
with_the
most_awful
fears,_not
daring_to
drag_away
my_hand;
yet_ever
thinking_that
if_I
could_but
stir_it
one_single
inch,_the
horrid_spell
would_be
broken._
I_knew
not_how
this_consciousness
at_last
glided_away
from_me;
but_waking
in_the
morning,_I
shudderingly_remembered
it_all,
and_for
days_and
weeks_and
months_afterwards
I_lost
myself_in
confounding_attempts
to_explain
the_mystery.
_Nay,
to_this
very_hour,
I_often
puzzle_myself
with_it.
_Now,
take_away
the_awful
fear,_and
my_sensations
at_feeling
the_supernatural
hand_in
mine_were
very_similar,
in_their
strangeness,_to
those_which
I_experienced
on_waking
up_and
seeing_Queequeg's
pagan_arm
thrown_round
me._
But_at
length_all
the_past
night's_events
soberly_recurred,
one_by
one,_in
fixed_reality,
and_then
I_lay
only_alive
to_the
comical_predicament.
_For
though_I
tried_to
move_his
arm--unlock_his
bridegroom_clasp--yet,
sleeping_as
he_was,
he_still
hugged_me
tightly,_as
though_naught
but_death
should_part
us_twain.
I_now
strove_to
rouse_him--"Queequeg!"--but
his_only
answer_was
a_snore.
_I
then_rolled
over,_my
neck_feeling
as_if
it_were
in_a
horse-collar;_and
suddenly_felt
a_slight
scratch._
Throwing_aside
the_counterpane,
there_lay
the_tomahawk
sleeping_by
the_savage's
side,_as
if_it
were_a
hatchet-faced_baby.
_A
pretty_pickle,
truly,_thought
I;_abed
here_in
a_strange
house_in
the_broad
day,_with
a_cannibal
and_a
tomahawk!_
"Queequeg!--in_the
name_of
goodness,_Queequeg,
wake!"_
At_length,
by_dint
of_much
wriggling,_and
loud_and
incessant_expostulations
upon_the
unbecomingness_of
his_hugging
a_fellow
male_in
that_matrimonial
sort_of
style,_I
succeeded_in
extracting_a
grunt;_and
presently,_he
drew_back
his_arm,
shook_himself
all_over
like_a
Newfoundland_dog
just_from
the_water,
and_sat
up_in
bed,_stiff
as_a
pike-staff,_looking
at_me,
and_rubbing
his_eyes
as_if
he_did
not_altogether
remember_how
I_came
to_be
there,_though
a_dim
consciousness_of
knowing_something
about_me
seemed_slowly
dawning_over
him._
Meanwhile,_I
lay_quietly
eyeing_him,
having_no
serious_misgivings
now,_and
bent_upon
narrowly_observing
so_curious
a_creature.
_When,
at_last,
his_mind
seemed_made
up_touching
the_character
of_his
bedfellow,_and
he_became,
as_it
were,_reconciled
to_the
fact;_he
jumped_out
upon_the
floor,_and
by_certain
signs_and
sounds_gave
me_to
understand_that,
if_it
pleased_me,
he_would
dress_first
and_then
leave_me
to_dress
afterwards,_leaving
the_whole
apartment_to
myself._
Thinks_I,
Queequeg,_under
the_circumstances,
this_is
a_very
civilized_overture;
but,_the
truth_is,
these_savages
have_an
innate_sense
of_delicacy,
say_what
you_will;
it_is
marvellous_how
essentially_polite
they_are.
_I
pay_this
particular_compliment
to_Queequeg,
because_he
treated_me
with_so
much_civility
and_consideration,
while_I
was_guilty
of_great
rudeness;_staring
at_him
from_the
bed,_and
watching_all
his_toilette
motions;_for
the_time
my_curiosity
getting_the
better_of
my_breeding.
_Nevertheless,
a_man
like_Queequeg
you_don't
see_every
day,_he
and_his
ways_were
well_worth
unusual_regarding.
_He
commenced_dressing
at_top
by_donning
his_beaver
hat,_a
very_tall
one,_by
the_by,
and_then--still
minus_his
trowsers--he_hunted
up_his
boots._
What_under
the_heavens
he_did
it_for,
I_cannot
tell,_but
his_next
movement_was
to_crush
himself--boots_in
hand,_and
hat_on--under
the_bed;
when,_from
sundry_violent
gaspings_and
strainings,_I
inferred_he
was_hard
at_work
booting_himself;
though_by
no_law
of_propriety
that_I
ever_heard
of,_is
any_man
required_to
be_private
when_putting
on_his
boots._
But_Queequeg,
do_you
see,_was
a_creature
in_the
transition_stage--neither
caterpillar_nor
butterfly._
He_was
just_enough
civilized_to
show_off
his_outlandishness
in_the
strangest_possible
manners._
His_education
was_not
yet_completed.
_He
was_an
undergraduate._
If_he
had_not
been_a
small_degree
civilized,_he
very_probably
would_not
have_troubled
himself_with
boots_at
all;_but
then,_if
he_had
not_been
still_a
savage,_he
never_would
have_dreamt
of_getting
under_the
bed_to
put_them
on._
At_last,
he_emerged
with_his
hat_very
much_dented
and_crushed
down_over
his_eyes,
and_began
creaking_and
limping_about
the_room,
as_if,
not_being
much_accustomed
to_boots,
his_pair
of_damp,
wrinkled_cowhide
ones--probably_not
made_to
order_either--rather
pinched_and
tormented_him
at_the
first_go
off_of
a_bitter
cold_morning.
_Seeing,
now,_that
there_were
no_curtains
to_the
window,_and
that_the
street_being
very_narrow,
the_house
opposite_commanded
a_plain
view_into
the_room,
and_observing
more_and
more_the
indecorous_figure
that_Queequeg
made,_staving
about_with
little_else
but_his
hat_and
boots_on;
I_begged
him_as
well_as
I_could,
to_accelerate
his_toilet
somewhat,_and
particularly_to
get_into
his_pantaloons
as_soon
as_possible.
_He
complied,_and
then_proceeded
to_wash
himself._
At_that
time_in
the_morning
any_Christian
would_have
washed_his
face;_but
Queequeg,_to
my_amazement,
contented_himself
with_restricting
his_ablutions
to_his
chest,_arms,
and_hands.
_He
then_donned
his_waistcoat,
and_taking
up_a
piece_of
hard_soap
on_the
wash-stand_centre
table,_dipped
it_into
water_and
commenced_lathering
his_face.
I_was
watching_to
see_where
he_kept
his_razor,
when_lo
and_behold,
he_takes
the_harpoon
from_the
bed_corner,
slips_out
the_long
wooden_stock,
unsheathes_the
head,_whets
it_a
little_on
his_boot,
and_striding
up_to
the_bit
of_mirror
against_the
wall,_begins
a_vigorous
scraping,_or
rather_harpooning
of_his
cheeks._
Thinks_I,
Queequeg,_this
is_using
Rogers's_best
cutlery_with
a_vengeance.
_Afterwards
I_wondered
the_less
at_this
operation_when
I_came
to_know
of_what
fine_steel
the_head
of_a
harpoon_is
made,_and
how_exceedingly
sharp_the
long_straight
edges_are
always_kept.
_The
rest_of
his_toilet
was_soon
achieved,_and
he_proudly
marched_out
of_the
room,_wrapped
up_in
his_great
pilot_monkey
jacket,_and
sporting_his
harpoon_like
a_marshal's
baton._
_
CHAPTER_5
_Breakfast.
_
I_quickly
followed_suit,
and_descending
into_the
bar-room_accosted
the_grinning
landlord_very
pleasantly._
I_cherished
no_malice
towards_him,
though_he
had_been
skylarking_with
me_not
a_little
in_the
matter_of
my_bedfellow.
_However,
a_good
laugh_is
a_mighty
good_thing,
and_rather
too_scarce
a_good
thing;_the
more's_the
pity._
So,_if
any_one
man,_in
his_own
proper_person,
afford_stuff
for_a
good_joke
to_anybody,
let_him
not_be
backward,_but
let_him
cheerfully_allow
himself_to
spend_and
be_spent
in_that
way._
And_the
man_that
has_anything
bountifully_laughable
about_him,
be_sure
there_is
more_in
that_man
than_you
perhaps_think
for._
The_bar-room
was_now
full_of
the_boarders
who_had
been_dropping
in_the
night_previous,
and_whom
I_had
not_as
yet_had
a_good
look_at.
They_were
nearly_all
whalemen;_chief
mates,_and
second_mates,
and_third
mates,_and
sea_carpenters,
and_sea
coopers,_and
sea_blacksmiths,
and_harpooneers,
and_ship
keepers;_a
brown_and
brawny_company,
with_bosky
beards;_an
unshorn,_shaggy
set,_all
wearing_monkey
jackets_for
morning_gowns.
_You
could_pretty
plainly_tell
how_long
each_one
had_been
ashore._This
young_fellow's
healthy_cheek
is_like
a_sun-toasted
pear_in
hue,_and
would_seem
to_smell
almost_as
musky;_he
cannot_have
been_three
days_landed
from_his
Indian_voyage.
_That
man_next
him_looks
a_few
shades_lighter;
you_might
say_a
touch_of
satin_wood
is_in
him._
In_the
complexion_of
a_third
still_lingers
a_tropic
tawn,_but
slightly_bleached
withal;_HE
doubtless_has
tarried_whole
weeks_ashore.
_But
who_could
show_a
cheek_like
Queequeg?_which,
barred_with
various_tints,
seemed_like
the_Andes'
western_slope,
to_show
forth_in
one_array,
contrasting_climates,
zone_by
zone._
"Grub,_ho!"
now_cried
the_landlord,
flinging_open
a_door,
and_in
we_went
to_breakfast.
_They
say_that
men_who
have_seen
the_world,
thereby_become
quite_at
ease_in
manner,_quite
self-possessed_in
company._
Not_always,
though:_Ledyard,
the_great
New_England
traveller,_and
Mungo_Park,
the_Scotch
one;_of
all_men,
they_possessed
the_least
assurance_in
the_parlor.
But_perhaps
the_mere
crossing_of
Siberia_in
a_sledge
drawn_by
dogs_as
Ledyard_did,
or_the
taking_a
long_solitary
walk_on
an_empty
stomach,_in
the_negro
heart_of
Africa,_which
was_the
sum_of
poor_Mungo's
performances--this_kind
of_travel,
I_say,
may_not
be_the
very_best
mode_of
attaining_a
high_social
polish._
Still,_for
the_most
part,_that
sort_of
thing_is
to_be
had_anywhere.
_These
reflections_just
here_are
occasioned_by
the_circumstance
that_after
we_were
all_seated
at_the
table,_and
I_was
preparing_to
hear_some
good_stories
about_whaling;
to_my
no_small
surprise,_nearly
every_man
maintained_a
profound_silence.
_And
not_only
that,_but
they_looked
embarrassed._
Yes,_here
were_a
set_of
sea-dogs,_many
of_whom
without_the
slightest_bashfulness
had_boarded
great_whales
on_the
high_seas--entire
strangers_to
them--and_duelled
them_dead
without_winking;
and_yet,
here_they
sat_at
a_social
breakfast_table--all
of_the
same_calling,
all_of
kindred_tastes--looking
round_as
sheepishly_at
each_other
as_though
they_had
never_been
out_of
sight_of
some_sheepfold
among_the
Green_Mountains.
_A
curious_sight;
these_bashful
bears,_these
timid_warrior
whalemen!_
But_as
for_Queequeg--why,
Queequeg_sat
there_among
them--at_the
head_of
the_table,
too,_it
so_chanced;
as_cool
as_an
icicle._
To_be
sure_I
cannot_say
much_for
his_breeding.
_His
greatest_admirer
could_not
have_cordially
justified_his
bringing_his
harpoon_into
breakfast_with
him,_and
using_it
there_without
ceremony;_reaching
over_the
table_with
it,_to
the_imminent
jeopardy_of
many_heads,
and_grappling
the_beefsteaks
towards_him.
_But
THAT_was
certainly_very
coolly_done
by_him,
and_every
one_knows
that_in
most_people's
estimation,_to
do_anything
coolly_is
to_do
it_genteelly.
_We
will_not
speak_of
all_Queequeg's
peculiarities_here;
how_he
eschewed_coffee
and_hot
rolls,_and
applied_his
undivided_attention
to_beefsteaks,
done_rare.
_Enough,
that_when
breakfast_was
over_he
withdrew_like
the_rest
into_the
public_room,
lighted_his
tomahawk-pipe,_and
was_sitting
there_quietly
digesting_and
smoking_with
his_inseparable
hat_on,
when_I
sallied_out
for_a
stroll._
_
CHAPTER_6
_The
Street._
_If
I_had
been_astonished
at_first
catching_a
glimpse_of
so_outlandish
an_individual
as_Queequeg
circulating_among
the_polite
society_of
a_civilized
town,_that
astonishment_soon
departed_upon
taking_my
first_daylight
stroll_through
the_streets
of_New
Bedford._
In_thoroughfares
nigh_the
docks,_any
considerable_seaport
will_frequently
offer_to
view_the
queerest_looking
nondescripts_from
foreign_parts.
_Even
in_Broadway
and_Chestnut
streets,_Mediterranean
mariners_will
sometimes_jostle
the_affrighted
ladies._
Regent_Street
is_not
unknown_to
Lascars_and
Malays;_and
at_Bombay,
in_the
Apollo_Green,
live_Yankees
have_often
scared_the
natives._
But_New
Bedford_beats
all_Water
Street_and
Wapping._
In_these
last-mentioned_haunts
you_see
only_sailors;
but_in
New_Bedford,
actual_cannibals
stand_chatting
at_street
corners;_savages
outright;_many
of_whom
yet_carry
on_their
bones_unholy
flesh._
It_makes
a_stranger
stare._
But,_besides
the_Feegeeans,
Tongatobooarrs,_Erromanggoans,
Pannangians,_and
Brighggians,_and,
besides_the
wild_specimens
of_the
whaling-craft_which
unheeded_reel
about_the
streets,_you
will_see
other_sights
still_more
curious,_certainly
more_comical.
_There
weekly_arrive
in_this
town_scores
of_green
Vermonters_and
New_Hampshire
men,_all
athirst_for
gain_and
glory_in
the_fishery.
_They
are_mostly
young,_of
stalwart_frames;
fellows_who
have_felled
forests,_and
now_seek
to_drop
the_axe
and_snatch
the_whale-lance.
Many_are
as_green
as_the
Green_Mountains
whence_they
came._
In_some
things_you
would_think
them_but
a_few
hours_old.
_Look
there!_that
chap_strutting
round_the
corner._
He_wears
a_beaver
hat_and
swallow-tailed_coat,
girdled_with
a_sailor-belt
and_sheath-knife.
Here_comes
another_with
a_sou'-wester
and_a
bombazine_cloak.
_No
town-bred_dandy
will_compare
with_a
country-bred_one--I
mean_a
downright_bumpkin
dandy--a_fellow
that,_in
the_dog-days,
will_mow
his_two
acres_in
buckskin_gloves
for_fear
of_tanning
his_hands.
_Now
when_a
country_dandy
like_this
takes_it
into_his
head_to
make_a
distinguished_reputation,
and_joins
the_great
whale-fishery,_you
should_see
the_comical
things_he
does_upon
reaching_the
seaport._
In_bespeaking
his_sea-outfit,
he_orders
bell-buttons_to
his_waistcoats;
straps_to
his_canvas
trowsers._
Ah,_poor
Hay-Seed!_how
bitterly_will
burst_those
straps_in
the_first
howling_gale,
when_thou
art_driven,
straps,_buttons,
and_all,
down_the
throat_of
the_tempest.
_But
think_not
that_this
famous_town
has_only
harpooneers,_cannibals,
and_bumpkins
to_show
her_visitors.
_Not
at_all.
_Still
New_Bedford
is_a
queer_place.
_Had
it_not
been_for
us_whalemen,
that_tract
of_land
would_this
day_perhaps
have_been
in_as
howling_condition
as_the
coast_of
Labrador._
As_it
is,_parts
of_her
back_country
are_enough
to_frighten
one,_they
look_so
bony._
The_town
itself_is
perhaps_the
dearest_place
to_live
in,_in
all_New
England._
It_is
a_land
of_oil,
true_enough:
but_not
like_Canaan;
a_land,
also,_of
corn_and
wine._The
streets_do
not_run
with_milk;
nor_in
the_spring-time
do_they
pave_them
with_fresh
eggs._
Yet,_in
spite_of
this,_nowhere
in_all
America_will
you_find
more_patrician-like
houses;_parks
and_gardens
more_opulent,
than_in
New_Bedford.
_Whence
came_they?
how_planted
upon_this
once_scraggy
scoria_of
a_country?
_Go
and_gaze
upon_the
iron_emblematical
harpoons_round
yonder_lofty
mansion,_and
your_question
will_be
answered._
Yes;_all
these_brave
houses_and
flowery_gardens
came_from
the_Atlantic,
Pacific,_and
Indian_oceans.
_One
and_all,
they_were
harpooned_and
dragged_up
hither_from
the_bottom
of_the
sea._
Can_Herr
Alexander_perform
a_feat
like_that?
_In
New_Bedford,
fathers,_they
say,_give
whales_for
dowers_to
their_daughters,
and_portion
off_their
nieces_with
a_few
porpoises_a-piece.
You_must
go_to
New_Bedford
to_see
a_brilliant
wedding;_for,
they_say,
they_have
reservoirs_of
oil_in
every_house,
and_every
night_recklessly
burn_their
lengths_in
spermaceti_candles.
_In
summer_time,
the_town
is_sweet
to_see;
full_of
fine_maples--long
avenues_of
green_and
gold._
And_in
August,_high
in_air,
the_beautiful
and_bountiful
horse-chestnuts,_candelabra-wise,
proffer_the
passer-by_their
tapering_upright
cones_of
congregated_blossoms.
_So
omnipotent_is
art;_which
in_many
a_district
of_New
Bedford_has
superinduced_bright
terraces_of
flowers_upon
the_barren
refuse_rocks
thrown_aside
at_creation's
final_day.
_And
the_women
of_New
Bedford,_they
bloom_like
their_own
red_roses.
But_roses
only_bloom
in_summer;
whereas_the
fine_carnation
of_their
cheeks_is
perennial_as
sunlight_in
the_seventh
heavens._
Elsewhere_match
that_bloom
of_theirs,
ye_cannot,
save_in
Salem,_where
they_tell
me_the
young_girls
breathe_such
musk,_their
sailor_sweethearts
smell_them
miles_off
shore,_as
though_they
were_drawing
nigh_the
odorous_Moluccas
instead_of
the_Puritanic
sands._
_
CHAPTER_7
_The
Chapel._
_In
this_same
New_Bedford
there_stands
a_Whaleman's
Chapel,_and
few_are
the_moody
fishermen,_shortly
bound_for
the_Indian
Ocean_or
Pacific,_who
fail_to
make_a
Sunday_visit
to_the
spot._
I_am
sure_that
I_did
not._
Returning_from
my_first
morning_stroll,
I_again
sallied_out
upon_this
special_errand.
_The
sky_had
changed_from
clear,_sunny
cold,_to
driving_sleet
and_mist.
_Wrapping
myself_in
my_shaggy
jacket_of
the_cloth
called_bearskin,
I_fought
my_way
against_the
stubborn_storm.
Entering,_I
found_a
small_scattered
congregation_of
sailors,_and
sailors'_wives
and_widows.
_A
muffled_silence
reigned,_only
broken_at
times_by
the_shrieks
of_the
storm._
Each_silent
worshipper_seemed
purposely_sitting
apart_from
the_other,
as_if
each_silent
grief_were
insular_and
incommunicable._
The_chaplain
had_not
yet_arrived;
and_there
these_silent
islands_of
men_and
women_sat
steadfastly_eyeing
several_marble
tablets,_with
black_borders,
masoned_into
the_wall
on_either
side_the
pulpit._
Three_of
them_ran
something_like
the_following,
but_I
do_not
pretend_to
quote:--_

OF_JOHN
TALBOT,_Who,

age_of
eighteen,_was

Near_the

OF_The
late_CAPTAIN
EZEKIEL_HARDY,
Who_in
the_bows
of_his

a_Sperm
Whale_on
the_coast
of_Japan,
AUGUST_3d,
1833._THIS
TABLET_Is
erected_to
his_Memory
BY_HIS
WIDOW._
Shaking_off
the_sleet
from_my
ice-glazed_hat
and_jacket,
I_seated
myself_near
the_door,
and_turning
sideways_was
surprised_to
see_Queequeg
near_me.
_Affected
by_the
solemnity_of
the_scene,
there_was
a_wondering
gaze_of
incredulous_curiosity
in_his
countenance._
This_savage
was_the
only_person
present_who
seemed_to
notice_my
entrance;_because
he_was
the_only
one_who
could_not
read,_and,
therefore,_was
not_reading
those_frigid
inscriptions_on
the_wall.
_Whether
any_of
the_relatives
of_the
seamen_whose
names_appeared
there_were
now_among
the_congregation,
I_knew
not;_but
so_many
are_the
unrecorded_accidents
in_the
fishery,_and
so_plainly
did_several
women_present
wear_the
countenance_if
not_the
trappings_of
some_unceasing
grief,_that
I_feel
sure_that
here_before
me_were
assembled_those,
in_whose
unhealing_hearts
the_sight
of_those
bleak_tablets
sympathetically_caused
the_old
wounds_to
bleed_afresh.
_Oh!
ye_whose
dead_lie
buried_beneath
the_green
grass;_who
standing_among
flowers_can
say--here,_HERE
lies_my
beloved;_ye
know_not
the_desolation
that_broods
in_bosoms
like_these.
_What
bitter_blanks
in_those
black-bordered_marbles
which_cover
no_ashes!
_What
despair_in
those_immovable
inscriptions!_
What_deadly
voids_and
unbidden_infidelities
in_the
lines_that
seem_to
gnaw_upon
all_Faith,
and_refuse
resurrections_to
the_beings
who_have
placelessly_perished
without_a
grave._
As_well
might_those
tablets_stand
in_the
cave_of
Elephanta_as
here._
In_what
census_of
living_creatures,
the_dead
of_mankind
are_included;
why_it
is_that
a_universal
proverb_says
of_them,
that_they
tell_no
tales,_though
containing_more
secrets_than
the_Goodwin
Sands;_how
it_is
that_to
his_name
who_yesterday
departed_for
the_other
world,_we
prefix_so
significant_and
infidel_a
word,_and
yet_do
not_thus
entitle_him,
if_he
but_embarks
for_the
remotest_Indies
of_this
living_earth;
why_the
Life_Insurance
Companies_pay
death-forfeitures_upon
immortals;_in
what_eternal,
unstirring_paralysis,
and_deadly,
hopeless_trance,
yet_lies
antique_Adam
who_died
sixty_round
centuries_ago;
how_it
is_that
we_still
refuse_to
be_comforted
for_those
who_we
nevertheless_maintain
are_dwelling
in_unspeakable
bliss;_why
all_the
living_so
strive_to
hush_all
the_dead;
wherefore_but
the_rumor
of_a
knocking_in
a_tomb
will_terrify
a_whole
city._
All_these
things_are
not_without
their_meanings.
_But
Faith,_like
a_jackal,
feeds_among
the_tombs,
and_even
from_these
dead_doubts
she_gathers
her_most
vital_hope.
_It
needs_scarcely
to_be
told,_with
what_feelings,
on_the
eve_of
a_Nantucket
voyage,_I
regarded_those
marble_tablets,
and_by
the_murky
light_of
that_darkened,
doleful_day
read_the
fate_of
the_whalemen
who_had
gone_before
me._
Yes,_Ishmael,
the_same
fate_may
be_thine.
_But
somehow_I
grew_merry
again._
Delightful_inducements
to_embark,
fine_chance
for_promotion,
it_seems--aye,
a_stove
boat_will
make_me
an_immortal
by_brevet.
_Yes,
there_is
death_in
this_business
of_whaling--a
speechlessly_quick
chaotic_bundling
of_a
man_into
Eternity._
But_what
then?_
Methinks_we
have_hugely
mistaken_this
matter_of
Life_and
Death._
Methinks_that
what_they
call_my
shadow_here
on_earth
is_my
true_substance.
_Methinks
that_in
looking_at
things_spiritual,
we_are
too_much
like_oysters
observing_the
sun_through
the_water,
and_thinking
that_thick
water_the
thinnest_of
air._Methinks
my_body
is_but
the_lees
of_my
better_being.
_In
fact_take
my_body
who_will,
take_it
I_say,
it_is
not_me.
_And
therefore_three
cheers_for
Nantucket;_and
come_a
stove_boat
and_stove
body_when
they_will,
for_stave
my_soul,
Jove_himself
cannot._
_
CHAPTER_8
_The
Pulpit._
_I
had_not
been_seated
very_long
ere_a
man_of
a_certain
venerable_robustness
entered;_immediately
as_the
storm-pelted_door
flew_back
upon_admitting
him,_a
quick_regardful
eyeing_of
him_by
all_the
congregation,_sufficiently
attested_that
this_fine
old_man
was_the
chaplain._
Yes,_it
was_the
famous_Father
Mapple,_so
called_by
the_whalemen,
among_whom
he_was
a_very
great_favourite.
_He
had_been
a_sailor
and_a
harpooneer_in
his_youth,
but_for
many_years
past_had
dedicated_his
life_to
the_ministry.
_At
the_time
I_now
write_of,
Father_Mapple
was_in
the_hardy
winter_of
a_healthy
old_age;
that_sort
of_old
age_which
seems_merging
into_a
second_flowering
youth,_for
among_all
the_fissures
of_his
wrinkles,_there
shone_certain
mild_gleams
of_a
newly_developing
bloom--the_spring
verdure_peeping
forth_even
beneath_February's
snow._
No_one
having_previously
heard_his
history,_could
for_the
first_time
behold_Father
Mapple_without
the_utmost
interest,_because
there_were
certain_engrafted
clerical_peculiarities
about_him,
imputable_to
that_adventurous
maritime_life
he_had
led._
When_he
entered_I
observed_that
he_carried
no_umbrella,
and_certainly
had_not
come_in
his_carriage,
for_his
tarpaulin_hat
ran_down
with_melting
sleet,_and
his_great
pilot_cloth
jacket_seemed
almost_to
drag_him
to_the
floor_with
the_weight
of_the
water_it
had_absorbed.
_However,
hat_and
coat_and
overshoes_were
one_by
one_removed,
and_hung
up_in
a_little
space_in
an_adjacent
corner;_when,
arrayed_in
a_decent
suit,_he
quietly_approached
the_pulpit.
_Like
most_old
fashioned_pulpits,
it_was
a_very
lofty_one,
and_since
a_regular
stairs_to
such_a
height_would,
by_its
long_angle
with_the
floor,_seriously
contract_the
already_small
area_of
the_chapel,
the_architect,
it_seemed,
had_acted
upon_the
hint_of
Father_Mapple,
and_finished
the_pulpit
without_a
stairs,_substituting
a_perpendicular
side_ladder,
like_those
used_in
mounting_a
ship_from
a_boat
at_sea.
The_wife
of_a
whaling_captain
had_provided
the_chapel
with_a
handsome_pair
of_red
worsted_man-ropes
for_this
ladder,_which,
being_itself
nicely_headed,
and_stained
with_a
mahogany_colour,
the_whole
contrivance,_considering
what_manner
of_chapel
it_was,
seemed_by
no_means
in_bad
taste._
Halting_for
an_instant
at_the
foot_of
the_ladder,
and_with
both_hands
grasping_the
ornamental_knobs
of_the
man-ropes,_Father
Mapple_cast
a_look
upwards,_and
then_with
a_truly
sailor-like_but
still_reverential
dexterity,_hand
over_hand,
mounted_the
steps_as
if_ascending
the_main-top
of_his
vessel._
The_perpendicular
parts_of
this_side
ladder,_as
is_usually
the_case
with_swinging
ones,_were
of_cloth-covered
rope,_only
the_rounds
were_of
wood,_so
that_at
every_step
there_was
a_joint.
_At
my_first
glimpse_of
the_pulpit,
it_had
not_escaped
me_that
however_convenient
for_a
ship,_these
joints_in
the_present
instance_seemed
unnecessary._For
I_was
not_prepared
to_see
Father_Mapple
after_gaining
the_height,
slowly_turn
round,_and
stooping_over
the_pulpit,
deliberately_drag
up_the
ladder_step
by_step,
till_the
whole_was
deposited_within,
leaving_him
impregnable_in
his_little
Quebec._
I_pondered
some_time
without_fully
comprehending_the
reason_for
this._Father
Mapple_enjoyed
such_a
wide_reputation
for_sincerity
and_sanctity,
that_I
could_not
suspect_him
of_courting
notoriety_by
any_mere
tricks_of
the_stage.
_No,
thought_I,
there_must
be_some
sober_reason
for_this
thing;_furthermore,
it_must
symbolize_something
unseen._
Can_it
be,_then,
that_by
that_act
of_physical
isolation,_he
signifies_his
spiritual_withdrawal
for_the
time,_from
all_outward
worldly_ties
and_connexions?
_Yes,
for_replenished
with_the
meat_and
wine_of
the_word,
to_the
faithful_man
of_God,
this_pulpit,
I_see,
is_a
self-containing_stronghold--a
lofty_Ehrenbreitstein,
with_a
perennial_well
of_water
within_the
walls._
But_the
side_ladder
was_not
the_only
strange_feature
of_the
place,_borrowed
from_the
chaplain's_former
sea-farings._
Between_the
marble_cenotaphs
on_either
hand_of
the_pulpit,
the_wall
which_formed
its_back
was_adorned
with_a
large_painting
representing_a
gallant_ship
beating_against
a_terrible
storm_off
a_lee
coast_of
black_rocks
and_snowy
breakers._
But_high
above_the
flying_scud
and_dark-rolling
clouds,_there
floated_a
little_isle
of_sunlight,
from_which
beamed_forth
an_angel's
face;_and
this_bright
face_shed
a_distinct
spot_of
radiance_upon
the_ship's
tossed_deck,
something_like
that_silver
plate_now
inserted_into
the_Victory's
plank_where
Nelson_fell.
_"Ah,
noble_ship,"
the_angel
seemed_to
say,_"beat
on,_beat
on,_thou
noble_ship,
and_bear
a_hardy
helm;_for
lo!_the
sun_is
breaking_through;
the_clouds
are_rolling
off--serenest_azure
is_at
hand."_
Nor_was
the_pulpit
itself_without
a_trace
of_the
same_sea-taste
that_had
achieved_the
ladder_and
the_picture.
_Its
panelled_front
was_in
the_likeness
of_a
ship's_bluff
bows,_and
the_Holy
Bible_rested
on_a
projecting_piece
of_scroll
work,_fashioned
after_a
ship's_fiddle-headed
beak._
What_could
be_more
full_of
meaning?--for_the
pulpit_is
ever_this
earth's_foremost
part;_all
the_rest
comes_in
its_rear;
the_pulpit
leads_the
world._
From_thence
it_is
the_storm
of_God's
quick_wrath
is_first
descried,_and
the_bow
must_bear
the_earliest
brunt._
From_thence
it_is
the_God
of_breezes
fair_or
foul_is
first_invoked
for_favourable
winds._
Yes,_the
world's_a
ship_on
its_passage
out,_and
not_a
voyage_complete;
and_the
pulpit_is
its_prow.
_
_CHAPTER
9_
The_Sermon.
_
Father_Mapple
rose,_and
in_a
mild_voice
of_unassuming
authority_ordered
the_scattered
people_to
condense._
"Starboard_gangway,
there!_side
away_to
larboard--larboard_gangway
to_starboard!
Midships!_midships!"
_There
was_a
low_rumbling
of_heavy
sea-boots_among
the_benches,
and_a
still_slighter
shuffling_of
women's_shoes,
and_all
was_quiet
again,_and
every_eye
on_the
preacher._
He_paused
a_little;
then_kneeling
in_the
pulpit's_bows,
folded_his
large_brown
hands_across
his_chest,
uplifted_his
closed_eyes,
and_offered
a_prayer
so_deeply
devout_that
he_seemed
kneeling_and
praying_at
the_bottom
of_the
sea._
This_ended,
in_prolonged
solemn_tones,
like_the
continual_tolling
of_a
bell_in
a_ship
that_is
foundering_at
sea_in
a_fog--in
such_tones
he_commenced
reading_the
following_hymn;
but_changing
his_manner
towards_the
concluding_stanzas,
burst_forth
with_a
pealing_exultation
and_joy--
_"The
ribs_and
terrors_in
the_whale,
Arched_over
me_a
dismal_gloom,
While_all
God's_sun-lit
waves_rolled
by,_And
lift_me
deepening_down
to_doom.
_"I
saw_the
opening_maw
of_hell,
With_endless
pains_and
sorrows_there;
Which_none
but_they
that_feel
can_tell--
Oh,_I
was_plunging
to_despair.
_"In
black_distress,
I_called
my_God,
When_I
could_scarce
believe_him
mine,_He
bowed_his
ear_to
my_complaints--
No_more
the_whale
did_me
confine._
"With_speed
he_flew
to_my
relief,_As
on_a
radiant_dolphin
borne;_Awful,
yet_bright,
as_lightning
shone_The
face_of
my_Deliverer
God._
"My_song
for_ever
shall_record
That_terrible,
that_joyful
hour;_I
give_the
glory_to
my_God,
His_all
the_mercy
and_the
power._
_Nearly
all_joined
in_singing
this_hymn,
which_swelled
high_above
the_howling
of_the
storm._
A_brief
pause_ensued;
the_preacher
slowly_turned
over_the
leaves_of
the_Bible,
and_at
last,_folding
his_hand
down_upon
the_proper
page,_said:
"Beloved_shipmates,
clinch_the
last_verse
of_the
first_chapter
of_Jonah--'And
God_had
prepared_a
great_fish
to_swallow
up_Jonah.'"
_"Shipmates,
this_book,
containing_only
four_chapters--four
yarns--is_one
of_the
smallest_strands
in_the
mighty_cable
of_the
Scriptures._Yet
what_depths
of_the
soul_does
Jonah's_deep
sealine_sound!
what_a
pregnant_lesson
to_us
is_this
prophet!_
What_a
noble_thing
is_that
canticle_in
the_fish's
belly!_
How_billow-like
and_boisterously
grand!_
We_feel
the_floods
surging_over
us;_we
sound_with
him_to
the_kelpy
bottom_of
the_waters;
sea-weed_and
all_the
slime_of
the_sea
is_about
us!_
But_WHAT
is_this
lesson_that
the_book
of_Jonah
teaches?_Shipmates,
it_is
a_two-stranded
lesson;_a
lesson_to
us_all
as_sinful
men,_and
a_lesson
to_me
as_a
pilot_of
the_living
God._
As_sinful
men,_it
is_a
lesson_to
us_all,
because_it
is_a
story_of
the_sin,
hard-heartedness,_suddenly
awakened_fears,
the_swift
punishment,_repentance,
prayers,_and
finally_the
deliverance_and
joy_of
Jonah._As
with_all
sinners_among
men,_the
sin_of
this_son
of_Amittai
was_in
his_wilful
disobedience_of
the_command
of_God--never
mind_now
what_that
command_was,
or_how
conveyed--which_he
found_a
hard_command.
But_all
the_things
that_God
would_have
us_do
are_hard
for_us
to_do--remember
that--and_hence,
he_oftener
commands_us
than_endeavors
to_persuade.
_And
if_we
obey_God,
we_must
disobey_ourselves;
and_it
is_in
this_disobeying
ourselves,_wherein
the_hardness
of_obeying
God_consists.
_"With
this_sin
of_disobedience
in_him,
Jonah_still
further_flouts
at_God,
by_seeking
to_flee
from_Him.
_He
thinks_that
a_ship
made_by
men_will
carry_him
into_countries
where_God
does_not
reign,_but
only_the
Captains_of
this_earth.
_He
skulks_about
the_wharves
of_Joppa,
and_seeks
a_ship
that's_bound
for_Tarshish.
_There
lurks,_perhaps,
a_hitherto
unheeded_meaning
here._
By_all
accounts_Tarshish
could_have
been_no
other_city
than_the
modern_Cadiz.
_That's
the_opinion
of_learned
men._
And_where
is_Cadiz,
shipmates?_
Cadiz_is
in_Spain;
as_far
by_water,
from_Joppa,
as_Jonah
could_possibly
have_sailed
in_those
ancient_days,
when_the
Atlantic_was
an_almost
unknown_sea.
Because_Joppa,
the_modern
Jaffa,_shipmates,
is_on
the_most
easterly_coast
of_the
Mediterranean,_the
Syrian;_and
Tarshish_or
Cadiz_more
than_two
thousand_miles
to_the
westward_from
that,_just
outside_the
Straits_of
Gibraltar._
See_ye
not_then,
shipmates,_that
Jonah_sought
to_flee
world-wide_from
God?_
Miserable_man!
_Oh!
most_contemptible
and_worthy
of_all
scorn;_with
slouched_hat
and_guilty
eye,_skulking
from_his
God;_prowling
among_the
shipping_like
a_vile
burglar_hastening
to_cross
the_seas.
_So
disordered,_self-condemning
is_his
look,_that
had_there
been_policemen
in_those
days,_Jonah,
on_the
mere_suspicion
of_something
wrong,_had
been_arrested
ere_he
touched_a
deck._
How_plainly
he's_a
fugitive!_no
baggage,_not
a_hat-box,
valise,_or
carpet-bag,--no_friends
accompany_him
to_the
wharf_with
their_adieux.
_At
last,_after
much_dodging
search,_he
finds_the
Tarshish_ship
receiving_the
last_items
of_her
cargo;_and
as_he
steps_on
board_to
see_its
Captain_in
the_cabin,
all_the
sailors_for
the_moment
desist_from
hoisting_in
the_goods,
to_mark
the_stranger's
evil_eye.
_Jonah
sees_this;
but_in
vain_he
tries_to
look_all
ease_and
confidence;_in
vain_essays
his_wretched
smile._
Strong_intuitions
of_the
man_assure
the_mariners
he_can
be_no
innocent._
In_their
gamesome_but
still_serious
way,_one
whispers_to
the_other--"Jack,
he's_robbed
a_widow;"
or,_"Joe,
do_you
mark_him;
he's_a
bigamist;"_or,
"Harry_lad,
I_guess
he's_the
adulterer_that
broke_jail
in_old
Gomorrah,_or
belike,_one
of_the
missing_murderers
from_Sodom."
_Another
runs_to
read_the
bill_that's
stuck_against
the_spile
upon_the
wharf_to
which_the
ship_is
moored,_offering
five_hundred
gold_coins
for_the
apprehension_of
a_parricide,
and_containing
a_description
of_his
person._
He_reads,
and_looks
from_Jonah
to_the
bill;_while
all_his
sympathetic_shipmates
now_crowd
round_Jonah,
prepared_to
lay_their
hands_upon
him._
Frighted_Jonah
trembles,_and
summoning_all
his_boldness
to_his
face,_only
looks_so
much_the
more_a
coward._
He_will
not_confess
himself_suspected;
but_that
itself_is
strong_suspicion.
So_he
makes_the
best_of
it;_and
when_the
sailors_find
him_not
to_be
the_man
that_is
advertised,_they
let_him
pass,_and
he_descends
into_the
cabin._
"'Who's_there?'
cries_the
Captain_at
his_busy
desk,_hurriedly
making_out
his_papers
for_the
Customs--'Who's_there?'
_Oh!
how_that
harmless_question
mangles_Jonah!
_For
the_instant
he_almost
turns_to
flee_again.
_But
he_rallies.
_'I
seek_a
passage_in
this_ship
to_Tarshish;
how_soon
sail_ye,
sir?'_
Thus_far
the_busy
Captain_had
not_looked
up_to
Jonah,_though
the_man
now_stands
before_him;
but_no
sooner_does
he_hear
that_hollow
voice,_than
he_darts
a_scrutinizing
glance._
'We_sail
with_the
next_coming
tide,'_at
last_he
slowly_answered,
still_intently
eyeing_him.
_'No
sooner,_sir?'--'Soon
enough_for
any_honest
man_that
goes_a
passenger.'_
Ha!_
Jonah,_that's
another_stab.
_But
he_swiftly
calls_away
the_Captain
from_that
scent._
'I'll_sail
with_ye,'--he
says,--'the_passage
money_how
much_is
that?--I'll_pay
now.'_For
it_is
particularly_written,
shipmates,_as
if_it
were_a
thing_not
to_be
overlooked_in
this_history,
'that_he
paid_the
fare_thereof'
ere_the
craft_did
sail._
And_taken
with_the
context,_this
is_full
of_meaning.
_"Now
Jonah's_Captain,
shipmates,_was
one_whose
discernment_detects
crime_in
any,_but
whose_cupidity
exposes_it
only_in
the_penniless.
In_this
world,_shipmates,
sin_that
pays_its
way_can
travel_freely,
and_without
a_passport;
whereas_Virtue,
if_a
pauper,_is
stopped_at
all_frontiers.
_So
Jonah's_Captain
prepares_to
test_the
length_of
Jonah's_purse,
ere_he
judge_him
openly._
He_charges
him_thrice
the_usual
sum;_and
it's_assented
to._
Then_the
Captain_knows
that_Jonah
is_a
fugitive;_but
at_the
same_time
resolves_to
help_a
flight_that
paves_its
rear_with
gold._
Yet_when
Jonah_fairly
takes_out
his_purse,
prudent_suspicions
still_molest
the_Captain.
_He
rings_every
coin_to
find_a
counterfeit._
Not_a
forger,_any
way,_he
mutters;_and
Jonah_is
put_down
for_his
passage._
'Point_out
my_state-room,
Sir,'_says
Jonah_now,
'I'm_travel-weary;
I_need
sleep.'_
'Thou_lookest
like_it,'
says_the
Captain,_'there's
thy_room.'
_Jonah
enters,_and
would_lock
the_door,
but_the
lock_contains
no_key.
_Hearing
him_foolishly
fumbling_there,
the_Captain
laughs_lowly
to_himself,
and_mutters
something_about
the_doors
of_convicts'
cells_being
never_allowed
to_be
locked_within.
_All
dressed_and
dusty_as
he_is,
Jonah_throws
himself_into
his_berth,
and_finds
the_little
state-room_ceiling
almost_resting
on_his
forehead._
The_air
is_close,
and_Jonah
gasps._
Then,_in
that_contracted
hole,_sunk,
too,_beneath
the_ship's
water-line,_Jonah
feels_the
heralding_presentiment
of_that
stifling_hour,
when_the
whale_shall
hold_him
in_the
smallest_of
his_bowels'
wards._
"Screwed_at
its_axis
against_the
side,_a
swinging_lamp
slightly_oscillates
in_Jonah's
room;_and
the_ship,
heeling_over
towards_the
wharf_with
the_weight
of_the
last_bales
received,_the
lamp,_flame
and_all,
though_in
slight_motion,
still_maintains
a_permanent
obliquity_with
reference_to
the_room;
though,_in
truth,_infallibly
straight_itself,
it_but
made_obvious
the_false,
lying_levels
among_which
it_hung.
_The
lamp_alarms
and_frightens
Jonah;_as
lying_in
his_berth
his_tormented
eyes_roll
round_the
place,_and
this_thus
far_successful
fugitive_finds
no_refuge
for_his
restless_glance.
_But
that_contradiction
in_the
lamp_more
and_more
appals_him.
_The
floor,_the
ceiling,_and
the_side,
are_all
awry._
'Oh!_so
my_conscience
hangs_in
me!'_he
groans,_'straight
upwards,_so
it_burns;
but_the
chambers_of
my_soul
are_all
in_crookedness!'
_"Like
one_who
after_a
night_of
drunken_revelry
hies_to
his_bed,
still_reeling,
but_with
conscience_yet
pricking_him,
as_the
plungings_of
the_Roman
race-horse_but
so_much
the_more
strike_his
steel_tags
into_him;
as_one
who_in
that_miserable
plight_still
turns_and
turns_in
giddy_anguish,
praying_God
for_annihilation
until_the
fit_be
passed;_and
at_last
amid_the
whirl_of
woe_he
feels,_a
deep_stupor
steals_over
him,_as
over_the
man_who
bleeds_to
death,_for
conscience_is
the_wound,
and_there's
naught_to
staunch_it;
so,_after
sore_wrestlings
in_his
berth,_Jonah's
prodigy_of
ponderous_misery
drags_him
drowning_down
to_sleep.
_"And
now_the
time_of
tide_has
come;_the
ship_casts
off_her
cables;_and
from_the
deserted_wharf
the_uncheered
ship_for
Tarshish,_all
careening,_glides
to_sea.
_That
ship,_my
friends,_was
the_first
of_recorded
smugglers!_the
contraband_was
Jonah._
But_the
sea_rebels;
he_will
not_bear
the_wicked
burden._
A_dreadful
storm_comes
on,_the
ship_is
like_to
break._
But_now
when_the
boatswain_calls
all_hands
to_lighten
her;_when
boxes,_bales,
and_jars
are_clattering
overboard;_when
the_wind
is_shrieking,
and_the
men_are
yelling,_and
every_plank
thunders_with
trampling_feet
right_over
Jonah's_head;
in_all
this_raging
tumult,_Jonah
sleeps_his
hideous_sleep.
_He
sees_no
black_sky
and_raging
sea,_feels
not_the
reeling_timbers,
and_little
hears_he
or_heeds
he_the
far_rush
of_the
mighty_whale,
which_even
now_with
open_mouth
is_cleaving
the_seas
after_him.
_Aye,
shipmates,_Jonah
was_gone
down_into
the_sides
of_the
ship--a_berth
in_the
cabin_as
I_have
taken_it,
and_was
fast_asleep.
_But
the_frightened
master_comes
to_him,
and_shrieks
in_his
dead_ear,
'What_meanest
thou,_O,
sleeper!_arise!'
Startled_from
his_lethargy
by_that
direful_cry,
Jonah_staggers
to_his
feet,_and
stumbling_to
the_deck,
grasps_a
shroud,_to
look_out
upon_the
sea._
But_at
that_moment
he_is
sprung_upon
by_a
panther_billow
leaping_over
the_bulwarks.
_Wave
after_wave
thus_leaps
into_the
ship,_and
finding_no
speedy_vent
runs_roaring
fore_and
aft,_till
the_mariners
come_nigh
to_drowning
while_yet
afloat._
And_ever,
as_the
white_moon
shows_her
affrighted_face
from_the
steep_gullies
in_the
blackness_overhead,
aghast_Jonah
sees_the
rearing_bowsprit
pointing_high
upward,_but
soon_beat
downward_again
towards_the
tormented_deep.
_"Terrors
upon_terrors
run_shouting
through_his
soul._
In_all
his_cringing
attitudes,_the
God-fugitive_is
now_too
plainly_known.
_The
sailors_mark
him;_more
and_more
certain_grow
their_suspicions
of_him,
and_at
last,_fully
to_test
the_truth,
by_referring
the_whole
matter_to
high_Heaven,
they_fall
to_casting
lots,_to
see_for
whose_cause
this_great
tempest_was
upon_them.
_The
lot_is
Jonah's;_that
discovered,_then
how_furiously
they_mob
him_with
their_questions.
'What_is
thine_occupation?
_Whence
comest_thou?
_Thy
country?_
What_people?
_But
mark_now,
my_shipmates,
the_behavior
of_poor
Jonah._
The_eager
mariners_but
ask_him
who_he
is,_and
where_from;
whereas,_they
not_only
receive_an
answer_to
those_questions,
but_likewise
another_answer
to_a
question_not
put_by
them,_but
the_unsolicited
answer_is
forced_from
Jonah_by
the_hard
hand_of
God_that
is_upon
him._
"'I_am
a_Hebrew,'
he_cries--and
then--'I_fear
the_Lord
the_God
of_Heaven
who_hath
made_the
sea_and
the_dry
land!'_
Fear_him,
O_Jonah?
Aye,_well
mightest_thou
fear_the
Lord_God
THEN!_
Straightway,_he
now_goes
on_to
make_a
full_confession;
whereupon_the
mariners_became
more_and
more_appalled,
but_still
are_pitiful.
_For
when_Jonah,
not_yet
supplicating_God
for_mercy,
since_he
but_too
well_knew
the_darkness
of_his
deserts,--when_wretched
Jonah_cries
out_to
them_to
take_him
and_cast
him_forth
into_the
sea,_for
he_knew
that_for
HIS_sake
this_great
tempest_was
upon_them;
they_mercifully
turn_from
him,_and
seek_by
other_means
to_save
the_ship.
_But
all_in
vain;_the
indignant_gale
howls_louder;
then,_with
one_hand
raised_invokingly
to_God,
with_the
other_they
not_unreluctantly
lay_hold
of_Jonah.
_"And
now_behold
Jonah_taken
up_as
an_anchor
and_dropped
into_the
sea;_when
instantly_an
oily_calmness
floats_out
from_the
east,_and
the_sea
is_still,
as_Jonah
carries_down
the_gale
with_him,
leaving_smooth
water_behind.
_He
goes_down
in_the
whirling_heart
of_such
a_masterless
commotion_that
he_scarce
heeds_the
moment_when
he_drops
seething_into
the_yawning
jaws_awaiting
him;_and
the_whale
shoots-to_all
his_ivory
teeth,_like
so_many
white_bolts,
upon_his
prison._
Then_Jonah
prayed_unto
the_Lord
out_of
the_fish's
belly._
But_observe
his_prayer,
and_learn
a_weighty
lesson._
For_sinful
as_he
is,_Jonah
does_not
weep_and
wail_for
direct_deliverance.
_He
feels_that
his_dreadful
punishment_is
just._
He_leaves
all_his
deliverance_to
God,_contenting
himself_with
this,_that
spite_of
all_his
pains_and
pangs,_he
will_still
look_towards
His_holy
temple._
And_here,
shipmates,_is
true_and
faithful_repentance;
not_clamorous
for_pardon,
but_grateful
for_punishment.
_And
how_pleasing
to_God
was_this
conduct_in
Jonah,_is
shown_in
the_eventual
deliverance_of
him_from
the_sea
and_the
whale._Shipmates,
I_do
not_place
Jonah_before
you_to
be_copied
for_his
sin_but
I_do
place_him
before_you
as_a
model_for
repentance._
Sin_not;
but_if
you_do,
take_heed
to_repent
of_it
like_Jonah."
_While
he_was
speaking_these
words,_the
howling_of
the_shrieking,
slanting_storm
without_seemed
to_add
new_power
to_the
preacher,_who,
when_describing
Jonah's_sea-storm,
seemed_tossed
by_a
storm_himself.
His_deep
chest_heaved
as_with
a_ground-swell;
his_tossed
arms_seemed
the_warring
elements_at
work;_and
the_thunders
that_rolled
away_from
off_his
swarthy_brow,
and_the
light_leaping
from_his
eye,_made
all_his
simple_hearers
look_on
him_with
a_quick
fear_that
was_strange
to_them.
_There
now_came
a_lull
in_his
look,_as
he_silently
turned_over
the_leaves
of_the
Book_once
more;_and,
at_last,
standing_motionless,
with_closed
eyes,_for
the_moment,
seemed_communing
with_God
and_himself.
_But
again_he
leaned_over
towards_the
people,_and
bowing_his
head_lowly,
with_an
aspect_of
the_deepest
yet_manliest
humility,_he
spake_these
words:_
"Shipmates,_God
has_laid
but_one
hand_upon
you;_both
his_hands
press_upon
me._
I_have
read_ye
by_what
murky_light
may_be
mine_the
lesson_that
Jonah_teaches
to_all
sinners;_and
therefore_to
ye,_and
still_more
to_me,
for_I
am_a
greater_sinner
than_ye.
_And
now_how
gladly_would
I_come
down_from
this_mast-head
and_sit
on_the
hatches_there
where_you
sit,_and
listen_as
you_listen,
while_some
one_of
you_reads
ME_that
other_and
more_awful
lesson_which
Jonah_teaches
to_ME,
as_a
pilot_of
the_living
God._
How_being
an_anointed
pilot-prophet,_or
speaker_of
true_things,
and_bidden
by_the
Lord_to
sound_those
unwelcome_truths
in_the
ears_of
a_wicked
Nineveh,_Jonah,
appalled_at
the_hostility
he_should
raise,_fled
from_his
mission,_and
sought_to
escape_his
duty_and
his_God
by_taking
ship_at
Joppa._
But_God
is_everywhere;
Tarshish_he
never_reached.
_As
we_have
seen,_God
came_upon
him_in
the_whale,
and_swallowed
him_down
to_living
gulfs_of
doom,_and
with_swift
slantings_tore
him_along
'into_the
midst_of
the_seas,'
where_the
eddying_depths
sucked_him
ten_thousand
fathoms_down,
and_'the
weeds_were
wrapped_about
his_head,'
and_all
the_watery
world_of
woe_bowled
over_him.
_Yet
even_then
beyond_the
reach_of
any_plummet--'out
of_the
belly_of
hell'--when_the
whale_grounded
upon_the
ocean's_utmost
bones,_even
then,_God
heard_the
engulphed,_repenting
prophet_when
he_cried.
_Then
God_spake
unto_the
fish;_and
from_the
shuddering_cold
and_blackness
of_the
sea,_the
whale_came
breeching_up
towards_the
warm_and
pleasant_sun,
and_all
the_delights
of_air
and_earth;
and_'vomited
out_Jonah
upon_the
dry_land;'
when_the
word_of
the_Lord
came_a
second_time;
and_Jonah,
bruised_and
beaten--his_ears,
like_two
sea-shells,_still
multitudinously_murmuring
of_the
ocean--Jonah_did
the_Almighty's
bidding._
And_what
was_that,
shipmates?_
To_preach
the_Truth
to_the
face_of
Falsehood!_
That_was
it!_
"This,_shipmates,
this_is
that_other
lesson;_and
woe_to
that_pilot
of_the
living_God
who_slights
it._
Woe_to
him_whom
this_world
charms_from
Gospel_duty!
_Woe
to_him
who_seeks
to_pour
oil_upon
the_waters
when_God
has_brewed
them_into
a_gale!
_Woe
to_him
who_seeks
to_please
rather_than
to_appal!
_Woe
to_him
whose_good
name_is
more_to
him_than
goodness!_
Woe_to
him_who,
in_this
world,_courts
not_dishonour!
_Woe
to_him
who_would
not_be
true,_even
though_to
be_false
were_salvation!
Yea,_woe
to_him
who,_as
the_great
Pilot_Paul
has_it,
while_preaching
to_others
is_himself
a_castaway!"
_He
dropped_and
fell_away
from_himself
for_a
moment;_then
lifting_his
face_to
them_again,
showed_a
deep_joy
in_his
eyes,_as
he_cried
out_with
a_heavenly
enthusiasm,--"But_oh!
shipmates!_on
the_starboard
hand_of
every_woe,
there_is
a_sure
delight;_and
higher_the
top_of
that_delight,
than_the
bottom_of
the_woe
is_deep.
_Is
not_the
main-truck_higher
than_the
kelson_is
low?_
Delight_is
to_him--a
far,_far
upward,_and
inward_delight--who
against_the
proud_gods
and_commodores
of_this
earth,_ever
stands_forth
his_own
inexorable_self.
Delight_is
to_him
whose_strong
arms_yet
support_him,
when_the
ship_of
this_base
treacherous_world
has_gone
down_beneath
him._
Delight_is
to_him,
who_gives
no_quarter
in_the
truth,_and
kills,_burns,
and_destroys
all_sin
though_he
pluck_it
out_from
under_the
robes_of
Senators_and
Judges._
Delight,--top-gallant_delight
is_to
him,_who
acknowledges_no
law_or
lord,_but
the_Lord
his_God,
and_is
only_a
patriot_to
heaven._
Delight_is
to_him,
whom_all
the_waves
of_the
billows_of
the_seas
of_the
boisterous_mob
can_never
shake_from
this_sure
Keel_of
the_Ages.
_And
eternal_delight
and_deliciousness
will_be
his,_who
coming_to
lay_him
down,_can
say_with
his_final
breath--O_Father!--chiefly
known_to
me_by
Thy_rod--mortal
or_immortal,
here_I
die._
I_have
striven_to
be_Thine,
more_than
to_be
this_world's,
or_mine
own._
Yet_this
is_nothing:
I_leave
eternity_to
Thee;_for
what_is
man_that
he_should
live_out
the_lifetime
of_his
God?"_
He_said
no_more,
but_slowly
waving_a
benediction,_covered
his_face
with_his
hands,_and
so_remained
kneeling,_till
all_the
people_had
departed,_and
he_was
left_alone
in_the
place._
_
CHAPTER_10
_A
Bosom_Friend.
_
Returning_to
the_Spouter-Inn
from_the
Chapel,_I
found_Queequeg
there_quite
alone;_he
having_left
the_Chapel
before_the
benediction_some
time._
He_was
sitting_on
a_bench
before_the
fire,_with
his_feet
on_the
stove_hearth,
and_in
one_hand
was_holding
close_up
to_his
face_that
little_negro
idol_of
his;_peering
hard_into
its_face,
and_with
a_jack-knife
gently_whittling
away_at
its_nose,
meanwhile_humming
to_himself
in_his
heathenish_way.
_But
being_now
interrupted,_he
put_up
the_image;
and_pretty
soon,_going
to_the
table,_took
up_a
large_book
there,_and
placing_it
on_his
lap_began
counting_the
pages_with
deliberate_regularity;
at_every
fiftieth_page--as
I_fancied--stopping
a_moment,
looking_vacantly
around_him,
and_giving
utterance_to
a_long-drawn
gurgling_whistle
of_astonishment.
_He
would_then
begin_again
at_the
next_fifty;
seeming_to
commence_at
number_one
each_time,
as_though
he_could
not_count
more_than
fifty,_and
it_was
only_by
such_a
large_number
of_fifties
being_found
together,_that
his_astonishment
at_the
multitude_of
pages_was
excited._
With_much
interest_I
sat_watching
him._
Savage_though
he_was,
and_hideously
marred_about
the_face--at
least_to
my_taste--his
countenance_yet
had_a
something_in
it_which
was_by
no_means
disagreeable._
You_cannot
hide_the
soul._
Through_all
his_unearthly
tattooings,_I
thought_I
saw_the
traces_of
a_simple
honest_heart;
and_in
his_large,
deep_eyes,
fiery_black
and_bold,
there_seemed
tokens_of
a_spirit
that_would
dare_a
thousand_devils.
_And
besides_all
this,_there
was_a
certain_lofty
bearing_about
the_Pagan,
which_even
his_uncouthness
could_not
altogether_maim.
_He
looked_like
a_man
who_had
never_cringed
and_never
had_had
a_creditor.
_Whether
it_was,
too,_that
his_head
being_shaved,
his_forehead
was_drawn
out_in
freer_and
brighter_relief,
and_looked
more_expansive
than_it
otherwise_would,
this_I
will_not
venture_to
decide;_but
certain_it
was_his
head_was
phrenologically_an
excellent_one.
_It
may_seem
ridiculous,_but
it_reminded
me_of
General_Washington's
head,_as
seen_in
the_popular
busts_of
him._
It_had
the_same
long_regularly
graded_retreating
slope_from
above_the
brows,_which
were_likewise
very_projecting,
like_two
long_promontories
thickly_wooded
on_top.
_Queequeg
was_George
Washington_cannibalistically
developed._
Whilst_I
was_thus
closely_scanning
him,_half-pretending
meanwhile_to
be_looking
out_at
the_storm
from_the
casement,_he
never_heeded
my_presence,
never_troubled
himself_with
so_much
as_a
single_glance;
but_appeared
wholly_occupied
with_counting
the_pages
of_the
marvellous_book.
_Considering
how_sociably
we_had
been_sleeping
together_the
night_previous,
and_especially
considering_the
affectionate_arm
I_had
found_thrown
over_me
upon_waking
in_the
morning,_I
thought_this
indifference_of
his_very
strange._
But_savages
are_strange
beings;_at
times_you
do_not
know_exactly
how_to
take_them.
_At
first_they
are_overawing;
their_calm
self-collectedness_of
simplicity_seems
a_Socratic
wisdom._
I_had
noticed_also
that_Queequeg
never_consorted
at_all,
or_but
very_little,
with_the
other_seamen
in_the
inn._
He_made
no_advances
whatever;_appeared
to_have
no_desire
to_enlarge
the_circle
of_his
acquaintances._
All_this
struck_me
as_mighty
singular;_yet,
upon_second
thoughts,_there
was_something
almost_sublime
in_it.
Here_was
a_man
some_twenty
thousand_miles
from_home,
by_the
way_of
Cape_Horn,
that_is--which
was_the
only_way
he_could
get_there--thrown
among_people
as_strange
to_him
as_though
he_were
in_the
planet_Jupiter;
and_yet
he_seemed
entirely_at
his_ease;
preserving_the
utmost_serenity;
content_with
his_own
companionship;_always
equal_to
himself._
Surely_this
was_a
touch_of
fine_philosophy;
though_no
doubt_he
had_never
heard_there
was_such
a_thing
as_that.
_But,
perhaps,_to
be_true
philosophers,_we
mortals_should
not_be
conscious_of
so_living
or_so
striving._
So_soon
as_I
hear_that
such_or
such_a
man_gives
himself_out
for_a
philosopher,_I
conclude_that,
like_the
dyspeptic_old
woman,_he
must_have
"broken_his
digester."_
As_I
sat_there
in_that
now_lonely
room;_the
fire_burning
low,_in
that_mild
stage_when,
after_its
first_intensity
has_warmed
the_air,
it_then
only_glows
to_be
looked_at;
the_evening
shades_and
phantoms_gathering
round_the
casements,_and
peering_in
upon_us
silent,_solitary
twain;_the
storm_booming
without_in
solemn_swells;
I_began
to_be
sensible_of
strange_feelings.
_I
felt_a
melting_in
me._
No_more
my_splintered
heart_and
maddened_hand
were_turned
against_the
wolfish_world.
_This
soothing_savage
had_redeemed
it._
There_he
sat,_his
very_indifference
speaking_a
nature_in
which_there
lurked_no
civilized_hypocrisies
and_bland
deceits._
Wild_he
was;_a
very_sight
of_sights
to_see;
yet_I
began_to
feel_myself
mysteriously_drawn
towards_him.
And_those
same_things
that_would
have_repelled
most_others,
they_were
the_very
magnets_that
thus_drew
me._
I'll_try
a_pagan
friend,_thought
I,_since
Christian_kindness
has_proved
but_hollow
courtesy._
I_drew
my_bench
near_him,
and_made
some_friendly
signs_and
hints,_doing
my_best
to_talk
with_him
meanwhile._
At_first
he_little
noticed_these
advances;_but
presently,_upon
my_referring
to_his
last_night's
hospitalities,_he
made_out
to_ask
me_whether
we_were
again_to
be_bedfellows.
_I
told_him
yes;_whereat
I_thought
he_looked
pleased,_perhaps
a_little
complimented._
We_then
turned_over
the_book
together,_and
I_endeavored
to_explain
to_him
the_purpose
of_the
printing,_and
the_meaning
of_the
few_pictures
that_were
in_it.
_Thus
I_soon
engaged_his
interest;_and
from_that
we_went
to_jabbering
the_best
we_could
about_the
various_outer
sights_to
be_seen
in_this
famous_town.
_Soon
I_proposed
a_social
smoke;_and,
producing_his
pouch_and
tomahawk,_he
quietly_offered
me_a
puff._
And_then
we_sat
exchanging_puffs
from_that
wild_pipe
of_his,
and_keeping
it_regularly
passing_between
us._
If_there
yet_lurked
any_ice
of_indifference
towards_me
in_the
Pagan's_breast,
this_pleasant,
genial_smoke
we_had,
soon_thawed
it_out,
and_left
us_cronies.
_He
seemed_to
take_to
me_quite
as_naturally
and_unbiddenly
as_I
to_him;
and_when
our_smoke
was_over,
he_pressed
his_forehead
against_mine,
clasped_me
round_the
waist,_and
said_that
henceforth_we
were_married;
meaning,_in
his_country's
phrase,_that
we_were
bosom_friends;
he_would
gladly_die
for_me,
if_need
should_be.
In_a
countryman,_this
sudden_flame
of_friendship
would_have
seemed_far
too_premature,
a_thing
to_be
much_distrusted;
but_in
this_simple
savage_those
old_rules
would_not
apply._
After_supper,
and_another
social_chat
and_smoke,
we_went
to_our
room_together.
_He
made_me
a_present
of_his
embalmed_head;
took_out
his_enormous
tobacco_wallet,
and_groping
under_the
tobacco,_drew
out_some
thirty_dollars
in_silver;
then_spreading
them_on
the_table,
and_mechanically
dividing_them
into_two
equal_portions,
pushed_one
of_them
towards_me,
and_said
it_was
mine._
I_was
going_to
remonstrate;_but
he_silenced
me_by
pouring_them
into_my
trowsers'_pockets.
_I
let_them
stay._
He_then
went_about
his_evening
prayers,_took
out_his
idol,_and
removed_the
paper_fireboard.
_By
certain_signs
and_symptoms,
I_thought
he_seemed
anxious_for
me_to
join_him;
but_well
knowing_what
was_to
follow,_I
deliberated_a
moment_whether,
in_case
he_invited
me,_I
would_comply
or_otherwise.
_I
was_a
good_Christian;
born_and
bred_in
the_bosom
of_the
infallible_Presbyterian
Church._
How_then
could_I
unite_with
this_wild
idolator_in
worshipping_his
piece_of
wood?_
But_what
is_worship?
thought_I.
Do_you
suppose_now,
Ishmael,_that
the_magnanimous
God_of
heaven_and
earth--pagans_and
all_included--can
possibly_be
jealous_of
an_insignificant
bit_of
black_wood?
_Impossible!
_But
what_is
worship?--to_do
the_will
of_God--THAT
is_worship.
_And
what_is
the_will
of_God?--to
do_to
my_fellow
man_what
I_would
have_my
fellow_man
to_do
to_me--THAT
is_the
will_of
God._
Now,_Queequeg
is_my
fellow_man.
_And
what_do
I_wish
that_this
Queequeg_would
do_to
me?_
Why,_unite
with_me
in_my
particular_Presbyterian
form_of
worship._Consequently,
I_must
then_unite
with_him
in_his;
ergo,_I
must_turn
idolator._
So_I
kindled_the
shavings;_helped
prop_up
the_innocent
little_idol;
offered_him
burnt_biscuit
with_Queequeg;
salamed_before
him_twice
or_thrice;
kissed_his
nose;_and
that_done,
we_undressed
and_went
to_bed,
at_peace
with_our
own_consciences
and_all
the_world.
But_we
did_not
go_to
sleep_without
some_little
chat._
How_it
is_I
know_not;
but_there
is_no
place_like
a_bed
for_confidential
disclosures_between
friends._
Man_and
wife,_they
say,_there
open_the
very_bottom
of_their
souls_to
each_other;
and_some
old_couples
often_lie
and_chat
over_old
times_till
nearly_morning.
_Thus,
then,_in
our_hearts'
honeymoon,_lay
I_and
Queequeg--a_cosy,
loving_pair.
_
_CHAPTER
11_
Nightgown._
_We
had_lain
thus_in
bed,_chatting
and_napping
at_short
intervals,_and
Queequeg_now
and_then
affectionately_throwing
his_brown
tattooed_legs
over_mine,
and_then
drawing_them
back;_so
entirely_sociable
and_free
and_easy
were_we;
when,_at
last,_by
reason_of
our_confabulations,
what_little
nappishness_remained
in_us
altogether_departed,
and_we
felt_like
getting_up
again,_though
day-break_was
yet_some
way_down
the_future.
_Yes,
we_became
very_wakeful;
so_much
so_that
our_recumbent
position_began
to_grow
wearisome,_and
by_little
and_little
we_found
ourselves_sitting
up;_the
clothes_well
tucked_around
us,_leaning
against_the
head-board_with
our_four
knees_drawn
up_close
together,_and
our_two
noses_bending
over_them,
as_if
our_kneepans
were_warming-pans.
_We
felt_very
nice_and
snug,_the
more_so
since_it
was_so
chilly_out
of_doors;
indeed_out
of_bed-clothes
too,_seeing
that_there
was_no
fire_in
the_room.
_The
more_so,
I_say,
because_truly
to_enjoy
bodily_warmth,
some_small
part_of
you_must
be_cold,
for_there
is_no
quality_in
this_world
that_is
not_what
it_is
merely_by
contrast._
Nothing_exists
in_itself.
_If
you_flatter
yourself_that
you_are
all_over
comfortable,_and
have_been
so_a
long_time,
then_you
cannot_be
said_to
be_comfortable
any_more.
_But
if,_like
Queequeg_and
me_in
the_bed,
the_tip
of_your
nose_or
the_crown
of_your
head_be
slightly_chilled,
why_then,
indeed,_in
the_general
consciousness_you
feel_most
delightfully_and
unmistakably_warm.
_For
this_reason
a_sleeping
apartment_should
never_be
furnished_with
a_fire,
which_is
one_of
the_luxurious
discomforts_of
the_rich.
_For
the_height
of_this
sort_of
deliciousness_is
to_have
nothing_but
the_blanket
between_you
and_your
snugness_and
the_cold
of_the
outer_air.
_Then
there_you
lie_like
the_one
warm_spark
in_the
heart_of
an_arctic
crystal._
We_had
been_sitting
in_this
crouching_manner
for_some
time,_when
all_at
once_I
thought_I
would_open
my_eyes;
for_when
between_sheets,
whether_by
day_or
by_night,
and_whether
asleep_or
awake,_I
have_a
way_of
always_keeping
my_eyes
shut,_in
order_the
more_to
concentrate_the
snugness_of
being_in
bed._
Because_no
man_can
ever_feel
his_own
identity_aright
except_his
eyes_be
closed;_as
if_darkness
were_indeed
the_proper
element_of
our_essences,
though_light
be_more
congenial_to
our_clayey
part._
Upon_opening
my_eyes
then,_and
coming_out
of_my
own_pleasant
and_self-created
darkness_into
the_imposed
and_coarse
outer_gloom
of_the
unilluminated_twelve-o'clock-at-night,
I_experienced
a_disagreeable
revulsion._
Nor_did
I_at
all_object
to_the
hint_from
Queequeg_that
perhaps_it
were_best
to_strike
a_light,
seeing_that
we_were
so_wide
awake;_and
besides_he
felt_a
strong_desire
to_have
a_few
quiet_puffs
from_his
Tomahawk._
Be_it
said,_that
though_I
had_felt
such_a
strong_repugnance
to_his
smoking_in
the_bed
the_night
before,_yet
see_how
elastic_our
stiff_prejudices
grow_when
love_once
comes_to
bend_them.
_For
now_I
liked_nothing
better_than
to_have
Queequeg_smoking
by_me,
even_in
bed,_because
he_seemed
to_be
full_of
such_serene
household_joy
then._
I_no
more_felt
unduly_concerned
for_the
landlord's_policy
of_insurance.
_I
was_only
alive_to
the_condensed
confidential_comfortableness
of_sharing
a_pipe
and_a
blanket_with
a_real
friend._
With_our
shaggy_jackets
drawn_about
our_shoulders,
we_now
passed_the
Tomahawk_from
one_to
the_other,
till_slowly
there_grew
over_us
a_blue
hanging_tester
of_smoke,
illuminated_by
the_flame
of_the
new-lit_lamp.
_Whether
it_was
that_this
undulating_tester
rolled_the
savage_away
to_far
distant_scenes,
I_know
not,_but
he_now
spoke_of
his_native
island;_and,
eager_to
hear_his
history,_I
begged_him
to_go
on_and
tell_it.
_He
gladly_complied.
_Though
at_the
time_I
but_ill
comprehended_not
a_few
of_his
words,_yet
subsequent_disclosures,
when_I
had_become
more_familiar
with_his
broken_phraseology,
now_enable
me_to
present_the
whole_story
such_as
it_may
prove_in
the_mere
skeleton_I
give._
_
CHAPTER_12
_Biographical.
_
Queequeg_was
a_native
of_Rokovoko,
an_island
far_away
to_the
West_and
South._
It_is
not_down
in_any
map;_true
places_never
are._
When_a
new-hatched_savage
running_wild
about_his
native_woodlands
in_a
grass_clout,
followed_by
the_nibbling
goats,_as
if_he
were_a
green_sapling;
even_then,
in_Queequeg's
ambitious_soul,
lurked_a
strong_desire
to_see
something_more
of_Christendom
than_a
specimen_whaler
or_two.
_His
father_was
a_High
Chief,_a
King;_his
uncle_a
High_Priest;
and_on
the_maternal
side_he
boasted_aunts
who_were
the_wives
of_unconquerable
warriors._
There_was
excellent_blood
in_his
veins--royal_stuff;
though_sadly
vitiated,_I
fear,_by
the_cannibal
propensity_he
nourished_in
his_untutored
youth._
A_Sag
Harbor_ship
visited_his
father's_bay,
and_Queequeg
sought_a
passage_to
Christian_lands.
_But
the_ship,
having_her
full_complement
of_seamen,
spurned_his
suit;_and
not_all
the_King
his_father's
influence_could
prevail._
But_Queequeg
vowed_a
vow._
Alone_in
his_canoe,
he_paddled
off_to
a_distant
strait,_which
he_knew
the_ship
must_pass
through_when
she_quitted
the_island.
_On
one_side
was_a
coral_reef;
on_the
other_a
low_tongue
of_land,
covered_with
mangrove_thickets
that_grew
out_into
the_water.
_Hiding
his_canoe,
still_afloat,
among_these
thickets,_with
its_prow
seaward,_he
sat_down
in_the
stern,_paddle
low_in
hand;_and
when_the
ship_was
gliding_by,
like_a
flash_he
darted_out;
gained_her
side;_with
one_backward
dash_of
his_foot
capsized_and
sank_his
canoe;_climbed
up_the
chains;_and
throwing_himself
at_full
length_upon
the_deck,
grappled_a
ring-bolt_there,
and_swore
not_to
let_it
go,_though
hacked_in
pieces._
In_vain
the_captain
threatened_to
throw_him
overboard;_suspended
a_cutlass
over_his
naked_wrists;
Queequeg_was
the_son
of_a
King,_and
Queequeg_budged
not._
Struck_by
his_desperate
dauntlessness,_and
his_wild
desire_to
visit_Christendom,
the_captain
at_last
relented,_and
told_him
he_might
make_himself
at_home.
_But
this_fine
young_savage--this
sea_Prince
of_Wales,
never_saw
the_Captain's
cabin._They
put_him
down_among
the_sailors,
and_made
a_whaleman
of_him.
_But
like_Czar
Peter_content
to_toil
in_the
shipyards_of
foreign_cities,
Queequeg_disdained
no_seeming
ignominy,_if
thereby_he
might_happily
gain_the
power_of
enlightening_his
untutored_countrymen.
_For
at_bottom--so
he_told
me--he_was
actuated_by
a_profound
desire_to
learn_among
the_Christians,
the_arts
whereby_to
make_his
people_still
happier_than
they_were;
and_more
than_that,
still_better
than_they
were._
But,_alas!
the_practices
of_whalemen
soon_convinced
him_that
even_Christians
could_be
both_miserable
and_wicked;
infinitely_more
so,_than
all_his
father's_heathens.
_Arrived
at_last
in_old
Sag_Harbor;
and_seeing
what_the
sailors_did
there;_and
then_going
on_to
Nantucket,_and
seeing_how
they_spent
their_wages
in_that
place_also,
poor_Queequeg
gave_it
up_for
lost._
Thought_he,
it's_a
wicked_world
in_all
meridians;_I'll
die_a
pagan._
And_thus
an_old
idolator_at
heart,_he
yet_lived
among_these
Christians,_wore
their_clothes,
and_tried
to_talk
their_gibberish.
Hence_the
queer_ways
about_him,
though_now
some_time
from_home.
_By
hints,_I
asked_him
whether_he
did_not
propose_going
back,_and
having_a
coronation;_since
he_might
now_consider
his_father
dead_and
gone,_he
being_very
old_and
feeble_at
the_last
accounts._
He_answered
no,_not
yet;_and
added_that
he_was
fearful_Christianity,
or_rather
Christians,_had
unfitted_him
for_ascending
the_pure
and_undefiled
throne_of
thirty_pagan
Kings_before
him._
But_by
and_by,
he_said,
he_would
return,--as_soon
as_he
felt_himself
baptized_again.
_For
the_nonce,
however,_he
proposed_to
sail_about,
and_sow
his_wild
oats_in
all_four
oceans._
They_had
made_a
harpooneer_of
him,_and
that_barbed
iron_was
in_lieu
of_a
sceptre_now.
_I
asked_him
what_might
be_his
immediate_purpose,
touching_his
future_movements.
_He
answered,_to
go_to
sea_again,
in_his
old_vocation.
Upon_this,
I_told
him_that
whaling_was
my_own
design,_and
informed_him
of_my
intention_to
sail_out
of_Nantucket,
as_being
the_most
promising_port
for_an
adventurous_whaleman
to_embark
from._
He_at
once_resolved
to_accompany
me_to
that_island,
ship_aboard
the_same
vessel,_get
into_the
same_watch,
the_same
boat,_the
same_mess
with_me,
in_short
to_share
my_every
hap;_with
both_my
hands_in
his,_boldly
dip_into
the_Potluck
of_both
worlds._
To_all
this_I
joyously_assented;
for_besides
the_affection
I_now
felt_for
Queequeg,_he
was_an
experienced_harpooneer,
and_as
such,_could
not_fail
to_be
of_great
usefulness_to
one,_who,
like_me,
was_wholly
ignorant_of
the_mysteries
of_whaling,
though_well
acquainted_with
the_sea,
as_known
to_merchant
seamen._
His_story
being_ended
with_his
pipe's_last
dying_puff,
Queequeg_embraced
me,_pressed
his_forehead
against_mine,
and_blowing
out_the
light,_we
rolled_over
from_each
other,_this
way_and
that,_and
very_soon
were_sleeping.
_
CHAPTER_13
_Wheelbarrow.
_
Next_morning,
Monday,_after
disposing_of
the_embalmed
head_to
a_barber,
for_a
block,_I
settled_my
own_and
comrade's_bill;
using,_however,
my_comrade's
money._
The_grinning
landlord,_as
well_as
the_boarders,
seemed_amazingly
tickled_at
the_sudden
friendship_which
had_sprung
up_between
me_and
Queequeg--especially_as
Peter_Coffin's
cock_and
bull_stories
about_him
had_previously
so_much
alarmed_me
concerning_the
very_person
whom_I
now_companied
with._
We_borrowed
a_wheelbarrow,
and_embarking
our_things,
including_my
own_poor
carpet-bag,_and
Queequeg's_canvas
sack_and
hammock,_away
we_went
down_to
"the_Moss,"
the_little
Nantucket_packet
schooner_moored
at_the
wharf._
As_we
were_going
along_the
people_stared;
not_at
Queequeg_so
much--for_they
were_used
to_seeing
cannibals_like
him_in
their_streets,--but
at_seeing
him_and
me_upon
such_confidential
terms._
But_we
heeded_them
not,_going
along_wheeling
the_barrow
by_turns,
and_Queequeg
now_and
then_stopping
to_adjust
the_sheath
on_his
harpoon_barbs.
_I
asked_him
why_he
carried_such
a_troublesome
thing_with
him_ashore,
and_whether
all_whaling
ships_did
not_find
their_own
harpoons._
To_this,
in_substance,
he_replied,
that_though
what_I
hinted_was
true_enough,
yet_he
had_a
particular_affection
for_his
own_harpoon,
because_it
was_of
assured_stuff,
well_tried
in_many
a_mortal
combat,_and
deeply_intimate
with_the
hearts_of
whales._
In_short,
like_many
inland_reapers
and_mowers,
who_go
into_the
farmers'_meadows
armed_with
their_own
scythes--though_in
no_wise
obliged_to
furnish_them--even
so,_Queequeg,
for_his
own_private
reasons,_preferred
his_own
harpoon._
Shifting_the
barrow_from
my_hand
to_his,
he_told
me_a
funny_story
about_the
first_wheelbarrow
he_had
ever_seen.
_It
was_in
Sag_Harbor.
The_owners
of_his
ship,_it
seems,_had
lent_him
one,_in
which_to
carry_his
heavy_chest
to_his
boarding_house.
_Not
to_seem
ignorant_about
the_thing--though
in_truth
he_was
entirely_so,
concerning_the
precise_way
in_which
to_manage
the_barrow--Queequeg
puts_his
chest_upon
it;_lashes
it_fast;
and_then
shoulders_the
barrow_and
marches_up
the_wharf.
_"Why,"
said_I,
"Queequeg,_you
might_have
known_better
than_that,
one_would
think._
Didn't_the
people_laugh?"
_Upon
this,_he
told_me
another_story.
_The
people_of
his_island
of_Rokovoko,
it_seems,
at_their
wedding_feasts
express_the
fragrant_water
of_young
cocoanuts_into
a_large
stained_calabash
like_a
punchbowl;_and
this_punchbowl
always_forms
the_great
central_ornament
on_the
braided_mat
where_the
feast_is
held._
Now_a
certain_grand
merchant_ship
once_touched
at_Rokovoko,
and_its
commander--from_all
accounts,_a
very_stately
punctilious_gentleman,
at_least
for_a
sea_captain--this
commander_was
invited_to
the_wedding
feast_of
Queequeg's_sister,
a_pretty
young_princess
just_turned
of_ten.
_Well;
when_all
the_wedding
guests_were
assembled_at
the_bride's
bamboo_cottage,
this_Captain
marches_in,
and_being
assigned_the
post_of
honour,_placed
himself_over
against_the
punchbowl,_and
between_the
High_Priest
and_his
majesty_the
King,_Queequeg's
father._
Grace_being
said,--for_those
people_have
their_grace
as_well
as_we--though
Queequeg_told
me_that
unlike_us,
who_at
such_times
look_downwards
to_our
platters,_they,
on_the
contrary,_copying
the_ducks,
glance_upwards
to_the
great_Giver
of_all
feasts--Grace,_I
say,_being
said,_the
High_Priest
opens_the
banquet_by
the_immemorial
ceremony_of
the_island;
that_is,
dipping_his
consecrated_and
consecrating_fingers
into_the
bowl_before
the_blessed
beverage_circulates.
_Seeing
himself_placed
next_the
Priest,_and
noting_the
ceremony,_and
thinking_himself--being
Captain_of
a_ship--as
having_plain
precedence_over
a_mere
island_King,
especially_in
the_King's
own_house--the
Captain_coolly
proceeds_to
wash_his
hands_in
the_punchbowl;--taking
it_I
suppose_for
a_huge
finger-glass._
"Now,"_said
Queequeg,_"what
you_tink
now?--Didn't_our
people_laugh?"
_At
last,_passage
paid,_and
luggage_safe,
we_stood
on_board
the_schooner.
_Hoisting
sail,_it
glided_down
the_Acushnet
river._
On_one
side,_New
Bedford_rose
in_terraces
of_streets,
their_ice-covered
trees_all
glittering_in
the_clear,
cold_air.
_Huge
hills_and
mountains_of
casks_on
casks_were
piled_upon
her_wharves,
and_side
by_side
the_world-wandering
whale_ships
lay_silent
and_safely
moored_at
last;_while
from_others
came_a
sound_of
carpenters_and
coopers,_with
blended_noises
of_fires
and_forges
to_melt
the_pitch,
all_betokening
that_new
cruises_were
on_the
start;_that
one_most
perilous_and
long_voyage
ended,_only
begins_a
second;_and
a_second
ended,_only
begins_a
third,_and
so_on,
for_ever
and_for
aye._
Such_is
the_endlessness,
yea,_the
intolerableness_of
all_earthly
effort._
Gaining_the
more_open
water,_the
bracing_breeze
waxed_fresh;
the_little
Moss_tossed
the_quick
foam_from
her_bows,
as_a
young_colt
his_snortings.
_How
I_snuffed
that_Tartar
air!--how_I
spurned_that
turnpike_earth!--that
common_highway
all_over
dented_with
the_marks
of_slavish
heels_and
hoofs;_and
turned_me
to_admire
the_magnanimity
of_the
sea_which
will_permit
no_records.
_At
the_same
foam-fountain,_Queequeg
seemed_to
drink_and
reel_with
me._His
dusky_nostrils
swelled_apart;
he_showed
his_filed
and_pointed
teeth._
On,_on
we_flew;
and_our
offing_gained,
the_Moss
did_homage
to_the
blast;_ducked
and_dived
her_bows
as_a
slave_before
the_Sultan.
Sideways_leaning,
we_sideways
darted;_every
ropeyarn_tingling
like_a
wire;_the
two_tall
masts_buckling
like_Indian
canes_in
land_tornadoes.
_So
full_of
this_reeling
scene_were
we,_as
we_stood
by_the
plunging_bowsprit,
that_for
some_time
we_did
not_notice
the_jeering
glances_of
the_passengers,
a_lubber-like
assembly,_who
marvelled_that
two_fellow
beings_should
be_so
companionable;_as
though_a
white_man
were_anything
more_dignified
than_a
whitewashed_negro.
_But
there_were
some_boobies
and_bumpkins
there,_who,
by_their
intense_greenness,
must_have
come_from
the_heart
and_centre
of_all
verdure._Queequeg
caught_one
of_these
young_saplings
mimicking_him
behind_his
back._
I_thought
the_bumpkin's
hour_of
doom_was
come._
Dropping_his
harpoon,_the
brawny_savage
caught_him
in_his
arms,_and
by_an
almost_miraculous
dexterity_and
strength,_sent
him_high
up_bodily
into_the
air;_then
slightly_tapping
his_stern
in_mid-somerset,
the_fellow
landed_with
bursting_lungs
upon_his
feet,_while
Queequeg,_turning
his_back
upon_him,
lighted_his
tomahawk_pipe
and_passed
it_to
me_for
a_puff.
_"Capting!
_Capting!
yelled_the
bumpkin,_running
towards_that
officer;_"Capting,
Capting,_here's
the_devil."
_"Hallo,
YOU_sir,"
cried_the
Captain,_a
gaunt_rib
of_the
sea,_stalking
up_to
Queequeg,_"what
in_thunder
do_you
mean_by
that?_
Don't_you
know_you
might_have
killed_that
chap?"_
"What_him
say?"_said
Queequeg,_as
he_mildly
turned_to
me._
"He_say,"
said_I,
"that_you
came_near
kill-e_that
man_there,"
pointing_to
the_still
shivering_greenhorn.
_"Kill-e,"
cried_Queequeg,
twisting_his
tattooed_face
into_an
unearthly_expression
of_disdain,
"ah!_him
bevy_small-e
fish-e;_Queequeg
no_kill-e
so_small-e
fish-e;_Queequeg
kill-e_big
whale!"_
"Look_you,"
roared_the
Captain,_"I'll
kill-e_YOU,
you_cannibal,
if_you
try_any
more_of
your_tricks
aboard_here;
so_mind
your_eye."
_But
it_so
happened_just
then,_that
it_was
high_time
for_the
Captain_to
mind_his
own_eye.
_The
prodigious_strain
upon_the
main-sail_had
parted_the
weather-sheet,_and
the_tremendous
boom_was
now_flying
from_side
to_side,
completely_sweeping
the_entire
after_part
of_the
deck._The
poor_fellow
whom_Queequeg
had_handled
so_roughly,
was_swept
overboard;_all
hands_were
in_a
panic;_and
to_attempt
snatching_at
the_boom
to_stay
it,_seemed
madness._
It_flew
from_right
to_left,
and_back
again,_almost
in_one
ticking_of
a_watch,
and_every
instant_seemed
on_the
point_of
snapping_into
splinters._
Nothing_was
done,_and
nothing_seemed
capable_of
being_done;
those_on
deck_rushed
towards_the
bows,_and
stood_eyeing
the_boom
as_if
it_were
the_lower
jaw_of
an_exasperated
whale._
In_the
midst_of
this_consternation,
Queequeg_dropped
deftly_to
his_knees,
and_crawling
under_the
path_of
the_boom,
whipped_hold
of_a
rope,_secured
one_end
to_the
bulwarks,_and
then_flinging
the_other
like_a
lasso,_caught
it_round
the_boom
as_it
swept_over
his_head,
and_at
the_next
jerk,_the
spar_was
that_way
trapped,_and
all_was
safe._
The_schooner
was_run
into_the
wind,_and
while_the
hands_were
clearing_away
the_stern
boat,_Queequeg,
stripped_to
the_waist,
darted_from
the_side
with_a
long_living
arc_of
a_leap.
For_three
minutes_or
more_he
was_seen
swimming_like
a_dog,
throwing_his
long_arms
straight_out
before_him,
and_by
turns_revealing
his_brawny
shoulders_through
the_freezing
foam._
I_looked
at_the
grand_and
glorious_fellow,
but_saw
no_one
to_be
saved._
The_greenhorn
had_gone
down._
Shooting_himself
perpendicularly_from
the_water,
Queequeg,_now
took_an
instant's_glance
around_him,
and_seeming
to_see
just_how
matters_were,
dived_down
and_disappeared.
_A
few_minutes
more,_and
he_rose
again,_one
arm_still
striking_out,
and_with
the_other
dragging_a
lifeless_form.
_The
boat_soon
picked_them
up._
The_poor
bumpkin_was
restored._
All_hands
voted_Queequeg
a_noble
trump;_the
captain_begged
his_pardon.
_From
that_hour
I_clove
to_Queequeg
like_a
barnacle;_yea,
till_poor
Queequeg_took
his_last
long_dive.
_Was
there_ever
such_unconsciousness?
_He
did_not
seem_to
think_that
he_at
all_deserved
a_medal
from_the
Humane_and
Magnanimous_Societies.
He_only
asked_for
water--fresh_water--something
to_wipe
the_brine
off;_that
done,_he
put_on
dry_clothes,
lighted_his
pipe,_and
leaning_against
the_bulwarks,
and_mildly
eyeing_those
around_him,
seemed_to
be_saying
to_himself--"It's
a_mutual,
joint-stock_world,
in_all
meridians._
We_cannibals
must_help
these_Christians."
_
_CHAPTER
14_
Nantucket._
_Nothing
more_happened
on_the
passage_worthy
the_mentioning;
so,_after
a_fine
run,_we
safely_arrived
in_Nantucket.
_Nantucket!
_Take
out_your
map_and
look_at
it._
See_what
a_real
corner_of
the_world
it_occupies;
how_it
stands_there,
away_off
shore,_more
lonely_than
the_Eddystone
lighthouse._
Look_at
it--a_mere
hillock,_and
elbow_of
sand;_all
beach,_without
a_background.
_There
is_more
sand_there
than_you
would_use
in_twenty
years_as
a_substitute
for_blotting
paper._
Some_gamesome
wights_will
tell_you
that_they
have_to
plant_weeds
there,_they
don't_grow
naturally;_that
they_import
Canada_thistles;
that_they
have_to
send_beyond
seas_for
a_spile
to_stop
a_leak
in_an
oil_cask;
that_pieces
of_wood
in_Nantucket
are_carried
about_like
bits_of
the_true
cross_in
Rome;_that
people_there
plant_toadstools
before_their
houses,_to
get_under
the_shade
in_summer
time;_that
one_blade
of_grass
makes_an
oasis,_three
blades_in
a_day's
walk_a
prairie;_that
they_wear
quicksand_shoes,
something_like
Laplander_snow-shoes;
that_they
are_so
shut_up,
belted_about,
every_way
inclosed,_surrounded,
and_made
an_utter
island_of
by_the
ocean,_that
to_their
very_chairs
and_tables
small_clams
will_sometimes
be_found
adhering,_as
to_the
backs_of
sea_turtles.
_But
these_extravaganzas
only_show
that_Nantucket
is_no
Illinois._
Look_now
at_the
wondrous_traditional
story_of
how_this
island_was
settled_by
the_red-men.
_Thus
goes_the
legend._
In_olden
times_an
eagle_swooped
down_upon
the_New
England_coast,
and_carried
off_an
infant_Indian
in_his
talons._
With_loud
lament_the
parents_saw
their_child
borne_out
of_sight
over_the
wide_waters.
_They
resolved_to
follow_in
the_same
direction._
Setting_out
in_their
canoes,_after
a_perilous
passage_they
discovered_the
island,_and
there_they
found_an
empty_ivory
casket,--the_poor
little_Indian's
skeleton._
What_wonder,
then,_that
these_Nantucketers,
born_on
a_beach,
should_take
to_the
sea_for
a_livelihood!
_They
first_caught
crabs_and
quohogs_in
the_sand;
grown_bolder,
they_waded
out_with
nets_for
mackerel;_more
experienced,_they
pushed_off
in_boats
and_captured
cod;_and
at_last,
launching_a
navy_of
great_ships
on_the
sea,_explored
this_watery
world;_put
an_incessant
belt_of
circumnavigations_round
it;_peeped
in_at
Behring's_Straits;
and_in
all_seasons
and_all
oceans_declared
everlasting_war
with_the
mightiest_animated
mass_that
has_survived
the_flood;
most_monstrous
and_most
mountainous!_
That_Himmalehan,
salt-sea_Mastodon,
clothed_with
such_portentousness
of_unconscious
power,_that
his_very
panics_are
more_to
be_dreaded
than_his
most_fearless
and_malicious
assaults!_
And_thus
have_these
naked_Nantucketers,
these_sea
hermits,_issuing
from_their
ant-hill_in
the_sea,
overrun_and
conquered_the
watery_world
like_so
many_Alexanders;
parcelling_out
among_them
the_Atlantic,
Pacific,_and
Indian_oceans,
as_the
three_pirate
powers_did
Poland._
Let_America
add_Mexico
to_Texas,
and_pile
Cuba_upon
Canada;_let
the_English
overswarm_all
India,_and
hang_out
their_blazing
banner_from
the_sun;
two_thirds
of_this
terraqueous_globe
are_the
Nantucketer's._
For_the
sea_is
his;_he
owns_it,
as_Emperors
own_empires;
other_seamen
having_but
a_right
of_way
through_it.
_Merchant
ships_are
but_extension
bridges;_armed
ones_but
floating_forts;
even_pirates
and_privateers,
though_following
the_sea
as_highwaymen
the_road,
they_but
plunder_other
ships,_other
fragments_of
the_land
like_themselves,
without_seeking
to_draw
their_living
from_the
bottomless_deep
itself._
The_Nantucketer,
he_alone
resides_and
riots_on
the_sea;
he_alone,
in_Bible
language,_goes
down_to
it_in
ships;_to
and_fro
ploughing_it
as_his
own_special
plantation._
THERE_is
his_home;
THERE_lies
his_business,
which_a
Noah's_flood
would_not
interrupt,_though
it_overwhelmed
all_the
millions_in
China._
He_lives
on_the
sea,_as
prairie_cocks
in_the
prairie;_he
hides_among
the_waves,
he_climbs
them_as
chamois_hunters
climb_the
Alps._
For_years
he_knows
not_the
land;_so
that_when
he_comes
to_it
at_last,
it_smells
like_another
world,_more
strangely_than
the_moon
would_to
an_Earthsman.
_With
the_landless
gull,_that
at_sunset
folds_her
wings_and
is_rocked
to_sleep
between_billows;
so_at
nightfall,_the
Nantucketer,_out
of_sight
of_land,
furls_his
sails,_and
lays_him
to_his
rest,_while
under_his
very_pillow
rush_herds
of_walruses
and_whales.
_
_CHAPTER
15_
Chowder._
_It
was_quite
late_in
the_evening
when_the
little_Moss
came_snugly
to_anchor,
and_Queequeg
and_I
went_ashore;
so_we
could_attend
to_no
business_that
day,_at
least_none
but_a
supper_and
a_bed.
_The
landlord_of
the_Spouter-Inn
had_recommended
us_to
his_cousin
Hosea_Hussey
of_the
Try_Pots,
whom_he
asserted_to
be_the
proprietor_of
one_of
the_best
kept_hotels
in_all
Nantucket,_and
moreover_he
had_assured
us_that
Cousin_Hosea,
as_he
called_him,
was_famous
for_his
chowders._In
short,_he
plainly_hinted
that_we
could_not
possibly_do
better_than
try_pot-luck
at_the
Try_Pots.
_But
the_directions
he_had
given_us
about_keeping
a_yellow
warehouse_on
our_starboard
hand_till
we_opened
a_white
church_to
the_larboard,
and_then
keeping_that
on_the
larboard_hand
till_we
made_a
corner_three
points_to
the_starboard,
and_that
done,_then
ask_the
first_man
we_met
where_the
place_was:
these_crooked
directions_of
his_very
much_puzzled
us_at
first,_especially
as,_at
the_outset,
Queequeg_insisted
that_the
yellow_warehouse--our
first_point
of_departure--must
be_left
on_the
larboard_hand,
whereas_I
had_understood
Peter_Coffin
to_say
it_was
on_the
starboard._However,
by_dint
of_beating
about_a
little_in
the_dark,
and_now
and_then
knocking_up
a_peaceable
inhabitant_to
inquire_the
way,_we
at_last
came_to
something_which
there_was
no_mistaking.
_Two
enormous_wooden
pots_painted
black,_and
suspended_by
asses'_ears,
swung_from
the_cross-trees
of_an
old_top-mast,
planted_in
front_of
an_old
doorway._
The_horns
of_the
cross-trees_were
sawed_off
on_the
other_side,
so_that
this_old
top-mast_looked
not_a
little_like
a_gallows.
_Perhaps
I_was
over_sensitive
to_such
impressions_at
the_time,
but_I
could_not
help_staring
at_this
gallows_with
a_vague
misgiving._
A_sort
of_crick
was_in
my_neck
as_I
gazed_up
to_the
two_remaining
horns;_yes,
TWO_of
them,_one
for_Queequeg,
and_one
for_me.
It's_ominous,
thinks_I.
_A
Coffin_my
Innkeeper_upon
landing_in
my_first
whaling_port;
tombstones_staring
at_me
in_the
whalemen's_chapel;
and_here
a_gallows!
and_a
pair_of
prodigious_black
pots_too!
Are_these
last_throwing
out_oblique
hints_touching
Tophet?_
I_was
called_from
these_reflections
by_the
sight_of
a_freckled
woman_with
yellow_hair
and_a
yellow_gown,
standing_in
the_porch
of_the
inn,_under
a_dull
red_lamp
swinging_there,
that_looked
much_like
an_injured
eye,_and
carrying_on
a_brisk
scolding_with
a_man
in_a
purple_woollen
shirt._
"Get_along
with_ye,"
said_she
to_the
man,_"or
I'll_be
combing_ye!"
_"Come
on,_Queequeg,"
said_I,
"all_right.
_There's
Mrs._Hussey."
_And
so_it
turned_out;
Mr._Hosea
Hussey_being
from_home,
but_leaving
Mrs._Hussey
entirely_competent
to_attend
to_all
his_affairs.
_Upon
making_known
our_desires
for_a
supper_and
a_bed,
Mrs._Hussey,
postponing_further
scolding_for
the_present,
ushered_us
into_a
little_room,
and_seating
us_at
a_table
spread_with
the_relics
of_a
recently_concluded
repast,_turned
round_to
us_and
said--"Clam_or
Cod?"_
"What's_that
about_Cods,
ma'am?"_said
I,_with
much_politeness.
_"Clam
or_Cod?"
she_repeated.
_"A
clam_for
supper?_a
cold_clam;
is_THAT
what_you
mean,_Mrs.
Hussey?"_says
I,_"but
that's_a
rather_cold
and_clammy
reception_in
the_winter
time,_ain't
it,_Mrs.
Hussey?"_
But_being
in_a
great_hurry
to_resume
scolding_the
man_in
the_purple
Shirt,_who
was_waiting
for_it
in_the
entry,_and
seeming_to
hear_nothing
but_the
word_"clam,"
Mrs._Hussey
hurried_towards
an_open
door_leading
to_the
kitchen,_and
bawling_out
"clam_for
two,"_disappeared.
_"Queequeg,"
said_I,
"do_you
think_that
we_can
make_out
a_supper
for_us
both_on
one_clam?"
_However,
a_warm
savory_steam
from_the
kitchen_served
to_belie
the_apparently
cheerless_prospect
before_us.
_But
when_that
smoking_chowder
came_in,
the_mystery
was_delightfully
explained._
Oh,_sweet
friends!_hearken
to_me.
_It
was_made
of_small
juicy_clams,
scarcely_bigger
than_hazel
nuts,_mixed
with_pounded
ship_biscuit,
and_salted
pork_cut
up_into
little_flakes;
the_whole
enriched_with
butter,_and
plentifully_seasoned
with_pepper
and_salt.
_Our
appetites_being
sharpened_by
the_frosty
voyage,_and
in_particular,
Queequeg_seeing
his_favourite
fishing_food
before_him,
and_the
chowder_being
surpassingly_excellent,
we_despatched
it_with
great_expedition:
when_leaning
back_a
moment_and
bethinking_me
of_Mrs.
Hussey's_clam
and_cod
announcement,_I
thought_I
would_try
a_little
experiment._
Stepping_to
the_kitchen
door,_I
uttered_the
word_"cod"
with_great
emphasis,_and
resumed_my
seat._
In_a
few_moments
the_savoury
steam_came
forth_again,
but_with
a_different
flavor,_and
in_good
time_a
fine_cod-chowder
was_placed
before_us.
_We
resumed_business;
and_while
plying_our
spoons_in
the_bowl,
thinks_I
to_myself,
I_wonder
now_if
this_here
has_any
effect_on
the_head?
What's_that
stultifying_saying
about_chowder-headed
people?_
"But_look,
Queequeg,_ain't
that_a
live_eel
in_your
bowl?_
Where's_your
harpoon?"_
Fishiest_of
all_fishy
places_was
the_Try
Pots,_which
well_deserved
its_name;
for_the
pots_there
were_always
boiling_chowders.
_Chowder
for_breakfast,
and_chowder
for_dinner,
and_chowder
for_supper,
till_you
began_to
look_for
fish-bones_coming
through_your
clothes._
The_area
before_the
house_was
paved_with
clam-shells._
Mrs._Hussey
wore_a
polished_necklace
of_codfish
vertebra;_and
Hosea_Hussey
had_his
account_books
bound_in
superior_old
shark-skin._
There_was
a_fishy
flavor_to
the_milk,
too,_which
I_could
not_at
all_account
for,_till
one_morning
happening_to
take_a
stroll_along
the_beach
among_some
fishermen's_boats,
I_saw
Hosea's_brindled
cow_feeding
on_fish
remnants,_and
marching_along
the_sand
with_each
foot_in
a_cod's
decapitated_head,
looking_very
slip-shod,_I
assure_ye.
_Supper
concluded,_we
received_a
lamp,_and
directions_from
Mrs._Hussey
concerning_the
nearest_way
to_bed;
but,_as
Queequeg_was
about_to
precede_me
up_the
stairs,_the
lady_reached
forth_her
arm,_and
demanded_his
harpoon;_she
allowed_no
harpoon_in
her_chambers.
_"Why
not?_said
I;_"every
true_whaleman
sleeps_with
his_harpoon--but
why_not?"
_"Because
it's_dangerous,"
says_she.
_"Ever
since_young
Stiggs_coming
from_that
unfort'nt_v'y'ge
of_his,
when_he
was_gone
four_years
and_a
half,_with
only_three
barrels_of
ILE,_was
found_dead
in_my
first_floor
back,_with
his_harpoon
in_his
side;_ever
since_then
I_allow
no_boarders
to_take
sich_dangerous
weepons_in
their_rooms
at_night.
_So,
Mr._Queequeg"
(for_she
had_learned
his_name),
"I_will
just_take
this_here
iron,_and
keep_it
for_you
till_morning.
_But
the_chowder;
clam_or
cod_to-morrow
for_breakfast,
men?"_
"Both,"_says
I;_"and
let's_have
a_couple
of_smoked
herring_by
way_of
variety."_
_
CHAPTER_16
_The
Ship._
_In
bed_we
concocted_our
plans_for
the_morrow.
_But
to_my
surprise_and
no_small
concern,_Queequeg
now_gave
me_to
understand,_that
he_had
been_diligently
consulting_Yojo--the
name_of
his_black
little_god--and
Yojo_had
told_him
two_or
three_times
over,_and
strongly_insisted
upon_it
everyway,_that
instead_of
our_going
together_among
the_whaling-fleet
in_harbor,
and_in
concert_selecting
our_craft;
instead_of
this,_I
say,_Yojo
earnestly_enjoined
that_the
selection_of
the_ship
should_rest
wholly_with
me,_inasmuch
as_Yojo
purposed_befriending
us;_and,
in_order
to_do
so,_had
already_pitched
upon_a
vessel,_which,
if_left
to_myself,
I,_Ishmael,
should_infallibly
light_upon,
for_all
the_world
as_though
it_had
turned_out
by_chance;
and_in
that_vessel
I_must
immediately_ship
myself,_for
the_present
irrespective_of
Queequeg._
I_have
forgotten_to
mention_that,
in_many
things,_Queequeg
placed_great
confidence_in
the_excellence
of_Yojo's
judgment_and
surprising_forecast
of_things;
and_cherished
Yojo_with
considerable_esteem,
as_a
rather_good
sort_of
god,_who
perhaps_meant
well_enough
upon_the
whole,_but
in_all
cases_did
not_succeed
in_his
benevolent_designs.
_Now,
this_plan
of_Queequeg's,
or_rather
Yojo's,_touching
the_selection
of_our
craft;_I
did_not
like_that
plan_at
all._
I_had
not_a
little_relied
upon_Queequeg's
sagacity_to
point_out
the_whaler
best_fitted
to_carry
us_and
our_fortunes
securely._
But_as
all_my
remonstrances_produced
no_effect
upon_Queequeg,
I_was
obliged_to
acquiesce;_and
accordingly_prepared
to_set
about_this
business_with
a_determined
rushing_sort
of_energy
and_vigor,
that_should
quickly_settle
that_trifling
little_affair.
_Next
morning_early,
leaving_Queequeg
shut_up
with_Yojo
in_our
little_bedroom--for
it_seemed
that_it
was_some
sort_of
Lent_or
Ramadan,_or
day_of
fasting,_humiliation,
and_prayer
with_Queequeg
and_Yojo
that_day;
HOW_it
was_I
never_could
find_out,
for,_though
I_applied
myself_to
it_several
times,_I
never_could
master_his
liturgies_and
XXXIX_Articles--leaving
Queequeg,_then,
fasting_on
his_tomahawk
pipe,_and
Yojo_warming
himself_at
his_sacrificial
fire_of
shavings,_I
sallied_out
among_the
shipping._After
much_prolonged
sauntering_and
many_random
inquiries,_I
learnt_that
there_were
three_ships
up_for
three-years'_voyages--The
Devil-dam,_the
Tit-bit,_and
the_Pequod.
_DEVIL-DAM,
I_do
not_know
the_origin
of;_TIT-BIT
is_obvious;
PEQUOD,_you
will_no
doubt_remember,
was_the
name_of
a_celebrated
tribe_of
Massachusetts_Indians;
now_extinct
as_the
ancient_Medes.
_I
peered_and
pryed_about
the_Devil-dam;
from_her,
hopped_over
to_the
Tit-bit;_and
finally,_going
on_board
the_Pequod,
looked_around
her_for
a_moment,
and_then
decided_that
this_was
the_very
ship_for
us._
You_may
have_seen
many_a
quaint_craft
in_your
day,_for
aught_I
know;--square-toed_luggers;
mountainous_Japanese
junks;_butter-box
galliots,_and
what_not;
but_take
my_word
for_it,
you_never
saw_such
a_rare
old_craft
as_this
same_rare
old_Pequod.
_She
was_a
ship_of
the_old
school,_rather
small_if
anything;_with
an_old-fashioned
claw-footed_look
about_her.
_Long
seasoned_and
weather-stained_in
the_typhoons
and_calms
of_all
four_oceans,
her_old
hull's_complexion
was_darkened
like_a
French_grenadier's,
who_has
alike_fought
in_Egypt
and_Siberia.
_Her
venerable_bows
looked_bearded.
_Her
masts--cut_somewhere
on_the
coast_of
Japan,_where
her_original
ones_were
lost_overboard
in_a
gale--her_masts
stood_stiffly
up_like
the_spines
of_the
three_old
kings_of
Cologne._
Her_ancient
decks_were
worn_and
wrinkled,_like
the_pilgrim-worshipped
flag-stone_in
Canterbury_Cathedral
where_Becket
bled._
But_to
all_these
her_old
antiquities,_were
added_new
and_marvellous
features,_pertaining
to_the
wild_business
that_for
more_than
half_a
century_she
had_followed.
_Old
Captain_Peleg,
many_years
her_chief-mate,
before_he
commanded_another
vessel_of
his_own,
and_now
a_retired
seaman,_and
one_of
the_principal
owners_of
the_Pequod,--this
old_Peleg,
during_the
term_of
his_chief-mateship,
had_built
upon_her
original_grotesqueness,
and_inlaid
it,_all
over,_with
a_quaintness
both_of
material_and
device,_unmatched
by_anything
except_it
be_Thorkill-Hake's
carved_buckler
or_bedstead.
_She
was_apparelled
like_any
barbaric_Ethiopian
emperor,_his
neck_heavy
with_pendants
of_polished
ivory._
She_was
a_thing
of_trophies.
_A
cannibal_of
a_craft,
tricking_herself
forth_in
the_chased
bones_of
her_enemies.
_All
round,_her
unpanelled,_open
bulwarks_were
garnished_like
one_continuous
jaw,_with
the_long
sharp_teeth
of_the
sperm_whale,
inserted_there
for_pins,
to_fasten
her_old
hempen_thews
and_tendons
to._
Those_thews
ran_not
through_base
blocks_of
land_wood,
but_deftly
travelled_over
sheaves_of
sea-ivory._Scorning
a_turnstile
wheel_at
her_reverend
helm,_she
sported_there
a_tiller;
and_that
tiller_was
in_one
mass,_curiously
carved_from
the_long
narrow_lower
jaw_of
her_hereditary
foe._
The_helmsman
who_steered
by_that
tiller_in
a_tempest,
felt_like
the_Tartar,
when_he
holds_back
his_fiery
steed_by
clutching_its
jaw._
A_noble
craft,_but
somehow_a
most_melancholy!
_All
noble_things
are_touched
with_that.
_Now
when_I
looked_about
the_quarter-deck,
for_some
one_having
authority,_in
order_to
propose_myself
as_a
candidate_for
the_voyage,
at_first
I_saw
nobody;_but
I_could
not_well
overlook_a
strange_sort
of_tent,
or_rather
wigwam,_pitched
a_little
behind_the
main-mast._
It_seemed
only_a
temporary_erection
used_in
port._
It_was
of_a
conical_shape,
some_ten
feet_high;
consisting_of
the_long,
huge_slabs
of_limber
black_bone
taken_from
the_middle
and_highest
part_of
the_jaws
of_the
right-whale._
Planted_with
their_broad
ends_on
the_deck,
a_circle
of_these
slabs_laced
together,_mutually
sloped_towards
each_other,
and_at
the_apex
united_in
a_tufted
point,_where
the_loose
hairy_fibres
waved_to
and_fro
like_the
top-knot_on
some_old
Pottowottamie_Sachem's
head._
A_triangular
opening_faced
towards_the
bows_of
the_ship,
so_that
the_insider
commanded_a
complete_view
forward._
And_half
concealed_in
this_queer
tenement,_I
at_length
found_one
who_by
his_aspect
seemed_to
have_authority;
and_who,
it_being
noon,_and
the_ship's
work_suspended,
was_now
enjoying_respite
from_the
burden_of
command._
He_was
seated_on
an_old-fashioned
oaken_chair,
wriggling_all
over_with
curious_carving;
and_the
bottom_of
which_was
formed_of
a_stout
interlacing_of
the_same
elastic_stuff
of_which
the_wigwam
was_constructed.
_There
was_nothing
so_very
particular,_perhaps,
about_the
appearance_of
the_elderly
man_I
saw;_he
was_brown
and_brawny,
like_most
old_seamen,
and_heavily
rolled_up
in_blue
pilot-cloth,_cut
in_the
Quaker_style;
only_there
was_a
fine_and
almost_microscopic
net-work_of
the_minutest
wrinkles_interlacing
round_his
eyes,_which
must_have
arisen_from
his_continual
sailings_in
many_hard
gales,_and
always_looking
to_windward;--for
this_causes
the_muscles
about_the
eyes_to
become_pursed
together._
Such_eye-wrinkles
are_very
effectual_in
a_scowl.
_"Is
this_the
Captain_of
the_Pequod?"
said_I,
advancing_to
the_door
of_the
tent._
"Supposing_it
be_the
captain_of
the_Pequod,
what_dost
thou_want
of_him?"
he_demanded.
_"I
was_thinking
of_shipping."
_"Thou
wast,_wast
thou?_
I_see
thou_art
no_Nantucketer--ever
been_in
a_stove
boat?"_
"No,_Sir,
I_never
have."_
"Dost_know
nothing_at
all_about
whaling,_I
dare_say--eh?
_"Nothing,
Sir;_but
I_have
no_doubt
I_shall
soon_learn.
_I've
been_several
voyages_in
the_merchant
service,_and
I_think
that--"_
"Merchant_service
be_damned.
_Talk
not_that
lingo_to
me._
Dost_see
that_leg?--I'll
take_that
leg_away
from_thy
stern,_if
ever_thou
talkest_of
the_marchant
service_to
me_again.
_Marchant
service_indeed!
_I
suppose_now
ye_feel
considerable_proud
of_having
served_in
those_marchant
ships._
But_flukes!
man,_what
makes_thee
want_to
go_a
whaling,_eh?--it
looks_a
little_suspicious,
don't_it,
eh?--Hast_not
been_a
pirate,_hast
thou?--Didst_not
rob_thy
last_Captain,
didst_thou?--Dost
not_think
of_murdering
the_officers
when_thou
gettest_to
sea?"_
I_protested
my_innocence
of_these
things._
I_saw
that_under
the_mask
of_these
half_humorous
innuendoes,_this
old_seaman,
as_an
insulated_Quakerish
Nantucketer,_was
full_of
his_insular
prejudices,_and
rather_distrustful
of_all
aliens,_unless
they_hailed
from_Cape
Cod_or
the_Vineyard.
_"But
what_takes
thee_a-whaling?
_I
want_to
know_that
before_I
think_of
shipping_ye."
_"Well,
sir,_I
want_to
see_what
whaling_is.
_I
want_to
see_the
world."_
"Want_to
see_what
whaling_is,
eh?_
Have_ye
clapped_eye
on_Captain
Ahab?"_
"Who_is
Captain_Ahab,
sir?"_
"Aye,_aye,
I_thought
so._
Captain_Ahab
is_the
Captain_of
this_ship."
_"I
am_mistaken
then._
I_thought
I_was
speaking_to
the_Captain
himself."_
"Thou_art
speaking_to
Captain_Peleg--that's
who_ye
are_speaking
to,_young
man._
It_belongs
to_me
and_Captain
Bildad_to
see_the
Pequod_fitted
out_for
the_voyage,
and_supplied
with_all
her_needs,
including_crew.
_We
are_part
owners_and
agents._
But_as
I_was
going_to
say,_if
thou_wantest
to_know
what_whaling
is,_as
thou_tellest
ye_do,
I_can
put_ye
in_a
way_of
finding_it
out_before
ye_bind
yourself_to
it,_past
backing_out.
_Clap
eye_on
Captain_Ahab,
young_man,
and_thou
wilt_find
that_he
has_only
one_leg."
_"What
do_you
mean,_sir?
_Was
the_other
one_lost
by_a
whale?"_
"Lost_by
a_whale!
_Young
man,_come
nearer_to
me:_it
was_devoured,
chewed_up,
crunched_by
the_monstrousest
parmacetty_that
ever_chipped
a_boat!--ah,
ah!"_
I_was
a_little
alarmed_by
his_energy,
perhaps_also
a_little
touched_at
the_hearty
grief_in
his_concluding
exclamation,_but
said_as
calmly_as
I_could,
"What_you
say_is
no_doubt
true_enough,
sir;_but
how_could
I_know
there_was
any_peculiar
ferocity_in
that_particular
whale,_though
indeed_I
might_have
inferred_as
much_from
the_simple
fact_of
the_accident."
_"Look
ye_now,
young_man,
thy_lungs
are_a
sort_of
soft,_d'ye
see;_thou
dost_not
talk_shark
a_bit.
_SURE,
ye've_been
to_sea
before_now;
sure_of
that?"_
"Sir,"_said
I,_"I
thought_I
told_you
that_I
had_been
four_voyages
in_the
merchant--"_
"Hard_down
out_of
that!_
Mind_what
I_said
about_the
marchant_service--don't
aggravate_me--I
won't_have
it._
But_let
us_understand
each_other.
_I
have_given
thee_a
hint_about
what_whaling
is;_do
ye_yet
feel_inclined
for_it?"
_"I
do,_sir."
_"Very
good._
Now,_art
thou_the
man_to
pitch_a
harpoon_down
a_live
whale's_throat,
and_then
jump_after
it?_
Answer,_quick!"
_"I
am,_sir,
if_it
should_be
positively_indispensable
to_do
so;_not
to_be
got_rid
of,_that
is;_which
I_don't
take_to
be_the
fact."_
"Good_again.
_Now
then,_thou
not_only
wantest_to
go_a-whaling,
to_find
out_by
experience_what
whaling_is,
but_ye
also_want
to_go
in_order
to_see
the_world?
_Was
not_that
what_ye
said?_
I_thought
so._Well
then,_just
step_forward
there,_and
take_a
peep_over
the_weather-bow,
and_then
back_to
me_and
tell_me
what_ye
see_there."
_For
a_moment
I_stood
a_little
puzzled_by
this_curious
request,_not
knowing_exactly
how_to
take_it,
whether_humorously
or_in
earnest._But
concentrating_all
his_crow's
feet_into
one_scowl,
Captain_Peleg
started_me
on_the
errand._
Going_forward
and_glancing
over_the
weather_bow,
I_perceived
that_the
ship_swinging
to_her
anchor_with
the_flood-tide,
was_now
obliquely_pointing
towards_the
open_ocean.
_The
prospect_was
unlimited,_but
exceedingly_monotonous
and_forbidding;
not_the
slightest_variety
that_I
could_see.
_"Well,
what's_the
report?"_said
Peleg_when
I_came
back;_"what
did_ye
see?"_
"Not_much,"
I_replied--"nothing
but_water;
considerable_horizon
though,_and
there's_a
squall_coming
up,_I
think."_
"Well,_what
does_thou
think_then
of_seeing
the_world?
_Do
ye_wish
to_go
round_Cape
Horn_to
see_any
more_of
it,_eh?
_Can't
ye_see
the_world
where_you
stand?"_
I_was
a_little
staggered,_but
go_a-whaling
I_must,
and_I
would;_and
the_Pequod
was_as
good_a
ship_as
any--I_thought
the_best--and
all_this
I_now
repeated_to
Peleg._
Seeing_me
so_determined,
he_expressed
his_willingness
to_ship
me._
"And_thou
mayest_as
well_sign
the_papers
right_off,"
he_added--"come
along_with
ye."_
And_so
saying,_he
led_the
way_below
deck_into
the_cabin.
_Seated
on_the
transom_was
what_seemed
to_me
a_most
uncommon_and
surprising_figure.
_It
turned_out
to_be
Captain_Bildad,
who_along
with_Captain
Peleg_was
one_of
the_largest
owners_of
the_vessel;
the_other
shares,_as
is_sometimes
the_case
in_these
ports,_being
held_by
a_crowd
of_old
annuitants;_widows,
fatherless_children,
and_chancery
wards;_each
owning_about
the_value
of_a
timber_head,
or_a
foot_of
plank,_or
a_nail
or_two
in_the
ship._
People_in
Nantucket_invest
their_money
in_whaling
vessels,_the
same_way
that_you
do_yours
in_approved
state_stocks
bringing_in
good_interest.
_Now,
Bildad,_like
Peleg,_and
indeed_many
other_Nantucketers,
was_a
Quaker,_the
island_having
been_originally
settled_by
that_sect;
and_to
this_day
its_inhabitants
in_general
retain_in
an_uncommon
measure_the
peculiarities_of
the_Quaker,
only_variously
and_anomalously
modified_by
things_altogether
alien_and
heterogeneous._
For_some
of_these
same_Quakers
are_the
most_sanguinary
of_all
sailors_and
whale-hunters._
They_are
fighting_Quakers;
they_are
Quakers_with
a_vengeance.
_So
that_there
are_instances
among_them
of_men,
who,_named
with_Scripture
names--a_singularly
common_fashion
on_the
island--and_in
childhood_naturally
imbibing_the
stately_dramatic
thee_and
thou_of
the_Quaker
idiom;_still,
from_the
audacious,_daring,
and_boundless
adventure_of
their_subsequent
lives,_strangely
blend_with
these_unoutgrown
peculiarities,_a
thousand_bold
dashes_of
character,_not
unworthy_a
Scandinavian_sea-king,
or_a
poetical_Pagan
Roman._
And_when
these_things
unite_in
a_man
of_greatly
superior_natural
force,_with
a_globular
brain_and
a_ponderous
heart;_who
has_also
by_the
stillness_and
seclusion_of
many_long
night-watches_in
the_remotest
waters,_and
beneath_constellations
never_seen
here_at
the_north,
been_led
to_think
untraditionally_and
independently;_receiving
all_nature's
sweet_or
savage_impressions
fresh_from
her_own
virgin_voluntary
and_confiding
breast,_and
thereby_chiefly,
but_with
some_help
from_accidental
advantages,_to
learn_a
bold_and
nervous_lofty
language--that_man
makes_one
in_a
whole_nation's
census--a_mighty
pageant_creature,
formed_for
noble_tragedies.
_Nor
will_it
at_all
detract_from
him,_dramatically
regarded,_if
either_by
birth_or
other_circumstances,
he_have
what_seems
a_half
wilful_overruling
morbidness_at
the_bottom
of_his
nature._
For_all
men_tragically
great_are
made_so
through_a
certain_morbidness.
_Be
sure_of
this,_O
young_ambition,
all_mortal
greatness_is
but_disease.
_But,
as_yet
we_have
not_to
do_with
such_an
one,_but
with_quite
another;_and
still_a
man,_who,
if_indeed
peculiar,_it
only_results
again_from
another_phase
of_the
Quaker,_modified
by_individual
circumstances._
Like_Captain
Peleg,_Captain
Bildad_was
a_well-to-do,
retired_whaleman.
_But
unlike_Captain
Peleg--who_cared
not_a
rush_for
what_are
called_serious
things,_and
indeed_deemed
those_self-same
serious_things
the_veriest
of_all
trifles--Captain_Bildad
had_not
only_been
originally_educated
according_to
the_strictest
sect_of
Nantucket_Quakerism,
but_all
his_subsequent
ocean_life,
and_the
sight_of
many_unclad,
lovely_island
creatures,_round
the_Horn--all
that_had
not_moved
this_native
born_Quaker
one_single
jot,_had
not_so
much_as
altered_one
angle_of
his_vest.
_Still,
for_all
this_immutableness,
was_there
some_lack
of_common
consistency_about
worthy_Captain
Peleg._
Though_refusing,
from_conscientious
scruples,_to
bear_arms
against_land
invaders,_yet
himself_had
illimitably_invaded
the_Atlantic
and_Pacific;
and_though
a_sworn
foe_to
human_bloodshed,
yet_had
he_in
his_straight-bodied
coat,_spilled
tuns_upon
tuns_of
leviathan_gore.
_How
now_in
the_contemplative
evening_of
his_days,
the_pious
Bildad_reconciled
these_things
in_the
reminiscence,_I
do_not
know;_but
it_did
not_seem
to_concern
him_much,
and_very
probably_he
had_long
since_come
to_the
sage_and
sensible_conclusion
that_a
man's_religion
is_one
thing,_and
this_practical
world_quite
another._This
world_pays
dividends._
Rising_from
a_little
cabin-boy_in
short_clothes
of_the
drabbest_drab,
to_a
harpooneer_in
a_broad
shad-bellied_waistcoat;
from_that
becoming_boat-header,
chief-mate,_and
captain,_and
finally_a
ship_owner;
Bildad,_as
I_hinted
before,_had
concluded_his
adventurous_career
by_wholly
retiring_from
active_life
at_the
goodly_age
of_sixty,
and_dedicating
his_remaining
days_to
the_quiet
receiving_of
his_well-earned
income._
Now,_Bildad,
I_am
sorry_to
say,_had
the_reputation
of_being
an_incorrigible
old_hunks,
and_in
his_sea-going
days,_a
bitter,_hard
task-master._
They_told
me_in
Nantucket,_though
it_certainly
seems_a
curious_story,
that_when
he_sailed
the_old
Categut_whaleman,
his_crew,
upon_arriving
home,_were
mostly_all
carried_ashore
to_the
hospital,_sore
exhausted_and
worn_out.
_For
a_pious
man,_especially
for_a
Quaker,_he
was_certainly
rather_hard-hearted,
to_say
the_least.
_He
never_used
to_swear,
though,_at
his_men,
they_said;
but_somehow
he_got
an_inordinate
quantity_of
cruel,_unmitigated
hard_work
out_of
them._
When_Bildad
was_a
chief-mate,_to
have_his
drab-coloured_eye
intently_looking
at_you,
made_you
feel_completely
nervous,_till
you_could
clutch_something--a
hammer_or
a_marling-spike,
and_go
to_work
like_mad,
at_something
or_other,
never_mind
what._
Indolence_and
idleness_perished
before_him.
_His
own_person
was_the
exact_embodiment
of_his
utilitarian_character.
_On
his_long,
gaunt_body,
he_carried
no_spare
flesh,_no
superfluous_beard,
his_chin
having_a
soft,_economical
nap_to
it,_like
the_worn
nap_of
his_broad-brimmed
hat._
Such,_then,
was_the
person_that
I_saw
seated_on
the_transom
when_I
followed_Captain
Peleg_down
into_the
cabin._
The_space
between_the
decks_was
small;_and
there,_bolt-upright,
sat_old
Bildad,_who
always_sat
so,_and
never_leaned,
and_this
to_save
his_coat
tails._
His_broad-brim
was_placed
beside_him;
his_legs
were_stiffly
crossed;_his
drab_vesture
was_buttoned
up_to
his_chin;
and_spectacles
on_nose,
he_seemed
absorbed_in
reading_from
a_ponderous
volume._
"Bildad,"_cried
Captain_Peleg,
"at_it
again,_Bildad,
eh?_
Ye_have
been_studying
those_Scriptures,
now,_for
the_last
thirty_years,
to_my
certain_knowledge.
_How
far_ye
got,_Bildad?"
_As
if_long
habituated_to
such_profane
talk_from
his_old
shipmate,_Bildad,
without_noticing
his_present
irreverence,_quietly
looked_up,
and_seeing
me,_glanced
again_inquiringly
towards_Peleg.
_"He
says_he's
our_man,
Bildad,"_said
Peleg,_"he
wants_to
ship."_
"Dost_thee?"
said_Bildad,
in_a
hollow_tone,
and_turning
round_to
me._
"I_dost,"
said_I
unconsciously,_he
was_so
intense_a
Quaker._
"What_do
ye_think
of_him,
Bildad?"_said
Peleg._
"He'll_do,"
said_Bildad,
eyeing_me,
and_then
went_on
spelling_away
at_his
book_in
a_mumbling
tone_quite
audible._
I_thought
him_the
queerest_old
Quaker_I
ever_saw,
especially_as
Peleg,_his
friend_and
old_shipmate,
seemed_such
a_blusterer.
_But
I_said
nothing,_only
looking_round
me_sharply.
_Peleg
now_threw
open_a
chest,_and
drawing_forth
the_ship's
articles,_placed
pen_and
ink_before
him,_and
seated_himself
at_a
little_table.
_I
began_to
think_it
was_high
time_to
settle_with
myself_at
what_terms
I_would
be_willing
to_engage
for_the
voyage._
I_was
already_aware
that_in
the_whaling
business_they
paid_no
wages;_but
all_hands,
including_the
captain,_received
certain_shares
of_the
profits_called
lays,_and
that_these
lays_were
proportioned_to
the_degree
of_importance
pertaining_to
the_respective
duties_of
the_ship's
company._
I_was
also_aware
that_being
a_green
hand_at
whaling,_my
own_lay
would_not
be_very
large;_but
considering_that
I_was
used_to
the_sea,
could_steer
a_ship,
splice_a
rope,_and
all_that,
I_made
no_doubt
that_from
all_I
had_heard
I_should
be_offered
at_least
the_275th
lay--that_is,
the_275th
part_of
the_clear
net_proceeds
of_the
voyage,_whatever
that_might
eventually_amount
to._
And_though
the_275th
lay_was
what_they
call_a
rather_LONG
LAY,_yet
it_was
better_than
nothing;_and
if_we
had_a
lucky_voyage,
might_pretty
nearly_pay
for_the
clothing_I
would_wear
out_on
it,_not
to_speak
of_my
three_years'
beef_and
board,_for
which_I
would_not
have_to
pay_one
stiver._
It_might
be_thought
that_this
was_a
poor_way
to_accumulate
a_princely
fortune--and_so
it_was,
a_very
poor_way
indeed._
But_I
am_one
of_those
that_never
take_on
about_princely
fortunes,_and
am_quite
content_if
the_world
is_ready
to_board
and_lodge
me,_while
I_am
putting_up
at_this
grim_sign
of_the
Thunder_Cloud.
_Upon
the_whole,
I_thought
that_the
275th_lay
would_be
about_the
fair_thing,
but_would
not_have
been_surprised
had_I
been_offered
the_200th,
considering_I
was_of
a_broad-shouldered
make._
But_one
thing,_nevertheless,
that_made
me_a
little_distrustful
about_receiving
a_generous
share_of
the_profits
was_this:
Ashore,_I
had_heard
something_of
both_Captain
Peleg_and
his_unaccountable
old_crony
Bildad;_how
that_they
being_the
principal_proprietors
of_the
Pequod,_therefore
the_other
and_more
inconsiderable_and
scattered_owners,
left_nearly
the_whole
management_of
the_ship's
affairs_to
these_two.
And_I
did_not
know_but
what_the
stingy_old
Bildad_might
have_a
mighty_deal
to_say
about_shipping
hands,_especially
as_I
now_found
him_on
board_the
Pequod,_quite
at_home
there_in
the_cabin,
and_reading
his_Bible
as_if
at_his
own_fireside.
_Now
while_Peleg
was_vainly
trying_to
mend_a
pen_with
his_jack-knife,
old_Bildad,
to_my
no_small
surprise,_considering
that_he
was_such
an_interested
party_in
these_proceedings;
Bildad_never
heeded_us,
but_went
on_mumbling
to_himself
out_of
his_book,
"LAY_not
up_for
yourselves_treasures
upon_earth,
where_moth--"
_"Well,
Captain_Bildad,"
interrupted_Peleg,
"what_d'ye
say,_what
lay_shall
we_give
this_young
man?"_
"Thou_knowest
best,"_was
the_sepulchral
reply,_"the
seven_hundred
and_seventy-seventh
wouldn't_be
too_much,
would_it?--'where
moth_and
rust_do
corrupt,_but
LAY--'"_
LAY,_indeed,
thought_I,
and_such
a_lay!
the_seven
hundred_and
seventy-seventh!_
Well,_old
Bildad,_you
are_determined
that_I,
for_one,
shall_not
LAY_up
many_LAYS
here_below,
where_moth
and_rust
do_corrupt.
_It
was_an
exceedingly_LONG
LAY_that,
indeed;_and
though_from
the_magnitude
of_the
figure_it
might_at
first_deceive
a_landsman,
yet_the
slightest_consideration
will_show
that_though
seven_hundred
and_seventy-seven
is_a
pretty_large
number,_yet,
when_you
come_to
make_a
TEENTH_of
it,_you
will_then
see,_I
say,_that
the_seven
hundred_and
seventy-seventh_part
of_a
farthing_is
a_good
deal_less
than_seven
hundred_and
seventy-seven_gold
doubloons;_and
so_I
thought_at
the_time.
_"Why,
blast_your
eyes,_Bildad,"
cried_Peleg,
"thou_dost
not_want
to_swindle
this_young
man!_he
must_have
more_than
that."_
"Seven_hundred
and_seventy-seventh,"
again_said
Bildad,_without
lifting_his
eyes;_and
then_went
on_mumbling--"for
where_your
treasure_is,
there_will
your_heart
be_also."
_"I
am_going
to_put
him_down
for_the
three_hundredth,"
said_Peleg,
"do_ye
hear_that,
Bildad!_
The_three
hundredth_lay,
I_say."
_Bildad
laid_down
his_book,
and_turning
solemnly_towards
him_said,
"Captain_Peleg,
thou_hast
a_generous
heart;_but
thou_must
consider_the
duty_thou
owest_to
the_other
owners_of
this_ship--widows
and_orphans,
many_of
them--and_that
if_we
too_abundantly
reward_the
labors_of
this_young
man,_we
may_be
taking_the
bread_from
those_widows
and_those
orphans._
The_seven
hundred_and
seventy-seventh_lay,
Captain_Peleg."
_"Thou
Bildad!"_roared
Peleg,_starting
up_and
clattering_about
the_cabin.
_"Blast
ye,_Captain
Bildad,_if
I_had
followed_thy
advice_in
these_matters,
I_would
afore_now
had_a
conscience_to
lug_about
that_would
be_heavy
enough_to
founder_the
largest_ship
that_ever
sailed_round
Cape_Horn."
_"Captain
Peleg,"_said
Bildad_steadily,
"thy_conscience
may_be
drawing_ten
inches_of
water,_or
ten_fathoms,
I_can't
tell;_but
as_thou
art_still
an_impenitent
man,_Captain
Peleg,_I
greatly_fear
lest_thy
conscience_be
but_a
leaky_one;
and_will
in_the
end_sink
thee_foundering
down_to
the_fiery
pit,_Captain
Peleg."_
"Fiery_pit!
fiery_pit!
ye_insult
me,_man;
past_all
natural_bearing,
ye_insult
me._
It's_an
all-fired_outrage
to_tell
any_human
creature_that
he's_bound
to_hell.
_Flukes
and_flames!
_Bildad,
say_that
again_to
me,_and
start_my
soul-bolts,_but
I'll--I'll--yes,_I'll
swallow_a
live_goat
with_all
his_hair
and_horns
on._
Out_of
the_cabin,
ye_canting,
drab-coloured_son
of_a
wooden_gun--a
straight_wake
with_ye!"
_As
he_thundered
out_this
he_made
a_rush
at_Bildad,
but_with
a_marvellous
oblique,_sliding
celerity,_Bildad
for_that
time_eluded
him._
Alarmed_at
this_terrible
outburst_between
the_two
principal_and
responsible_owners
of_the
ship,_and
feeling_half
a_mind
to_give
up_all
idea_of
sailing_in
a_vessel
so_questionably
owned_and
temporarily_commanded,
I_stepped
aside_from
the_door
to_give
egress_to
Bildad,_who,
I_made
no_doubt,
was_all
eagerness_to
vanish_from
before_the
awakened_wrath
of_Peleg.
_But
to_my
astonishment,_he
sat_down
again_on
the_transom
very_quietly,
and_seemed
to_have
not_the
slightest_intention
of_withdrawing.
_He
seemed_quite
used_to
impenitent_Peleg
and_his
ways._
As_for
Peleg,_after
letting_off
his_rage
as_he
had,_there
seemed_no
more_left
in_him,
and_he,
too,_sat
down_like
a_lamb,
though_he
twitched_a
little_as
if_still
nervously_agitated.
_"Whew!"
he_whistled
at_last--"the
squall's_gone
off_to
leeward,_I
think._Bildad,
thou_used
to_be
good_at
sharpening_a
lance,_mend
that_pen,
will_ye.
_My
jack-knife_here
needs_the
grindstone._
That's_he;
thank_ye,
Bildad._
Now_then,
my_young
man,_Ishmael's
thy_name,
didn't_ye
say?_
Well_then,
down_ye
go_here,
Ishmael,_for
the_three
hundredth_lay."
_"Captain
Peleg,"_said
I,_"I
have_a
friend_with
me_who
wants_to
ship_too--shall
I_bring
him_down
to-morrow?"_
"To_be
sure,"_said
Peleg._
"Fetch_him
along,_and
we'll_look
at_him."
_"What
lay_does
he_want?"
groaned_Bildad,
glancing_up
from_the
book_in
which_he
had_again
been_burying
himself._
"Oh!_never
thee_mind
about_that,
Bildad,"_said
Peleg._
"Has_he
ever_whaled
it_any?"
turning_to
me._
"Killed_more
whales_than
I_can
count,_Captain
Peleg."_
"Well,_bring
him_along
then."_
And,_after
signing_the
papers,_off
I_went;
nothing_doubting
but_that
I_had
done_a
good_morning's
work,_and
that_the
Pequod_was
the_identical
ship_that
Yojo_had
provided_to
carry_Queequeg
and_me
round_the
Cape._
But_I
had_not
proceeded_far,
when_I
began_to
bethink_me
that_the
Captain_with
whom_I
was_to
sail_yet
remained_unseen
by_me;
though,_indeed,
in_many
cases,_a
whale-ship_will
be_completely
fitted_out,
and_receive
all_her
crew_on
board,_ere
the_captain
makes_himself
visible_by
arriving_to
take_command;
for_sometimes
these_voyages
are_so
prolonged,_and
the_shore
intervals_at
home_so
exceedingly_brief,
that_if
the_captain
have_a
family,_or
any_absorbing
concernment_of
that_sort,
he_does
not_trouble
himself_much
about_his
ship_in
port,_but
leaves_her
to_the
owners_till
all_is
ready_for
sea._
However,_it
is_always
as_well
to_have
a_look
at_him
before_irrevocably
committing_yourself
into_his
hands._
Turning_back
I_accosted
Captain_Peleg,
inquiring_where
Captain_Ahab
was_to
be_found.
_"And
what_dost
thou_want
of_Captain
Ahab?_
It's_all
right_enough;
thou_art
shipped."_
"Yes,_but
I_should
like_to
see_him."
_"But
I_don't
think_thou
wilt_be
able_to
at_present.
_I
don't_know
exactly_what's
the_matter
with_him;
but_he
keeps_close
inside_the
house;_a
sort_of
sick,_and
yet_he
don't_look
so._
In_fact,
he_ain't
sick;_but
no,_he
isn't_well
either._
Any_how,
young_man,
he_won't
always_see
me,_so
I_don't
suppose_he
will_thee.
_He's
a_queer
man,_Captain
Ahab--so_some
think--but_a
good_one.
_Oh,
thou'lt_like
him_well
enough;_no
fear,_no
fear._
He's_a
grand,_ungodly,
god-like_man,
Captain_Ahab;
doesn't_speak
much;_but,
when_he
does_speak,
then_you
may_well
listen._
Mark_ye,
be_forewarned;
Ahab's_above
the_common;
Ahab's_been
in_colleges,
as_well
as_'mong
the_cannibals;
been_used
to_deeper
wonders_than
the_waves;
fixed_his
fiery_lance
in_mightier,
stranger_foes
than_whales.
_His
lance!_aye,
the_keenest
and_the
surest_that
out_of
all_our
isle!_
Oh!_he
ain't_Captain
Bildad;_no,
and_he
ain't_Captain
Peleg;_HE'S
AHAB,_boy;
and_Ahab
of_old,
thou_knowest,
was_a
crowned_king!"
_"And
a_very
vile_one.
_When
that_wicked
king_was
slain,_the
dogs,_did
they_not
lick_his
blood?"_
"Come_hither
to_me--hither,
hither,"_said
Peleg,_with
a_significance
in_his
eye_that
almost_startled
me._
"Look_ye,
lad;_never
say_that
on_board
the_Pequod.
_Never
say_it
anywhere._
Captain_Ahab
did_not
name_himself.
_'Twas
a_foolish,
ignorant_whim
of_his
crazy,_widowed
mother,_who
died_when
he_was
only_a
twelvemonth_old.
_And
yet_the
old_squaw
Tistig,_at
Gayhead,_said
that_the
name_would
somehow_prove
prophetic._
And,_perhaps,
other_fools
like_her
may_tell
thee_the
same._
I_wish
to_warn
thee._
It's_a
lie._
I_know
Captain_Ahab
well;_I've
sailed_with
him_as
mate_years
ago;_I
know_what
he_is--a
good_man--not
a_pious,
good_man,
like_Bildad,
but_a
swearing_good
man--something_like
me--only_there's
a_good
deal_more
of_him.
_Aye,
aye,_I
know_that
he_was
never_very
jolly;_and
I_know
that_on
the_passage
home,_he
was_a
little_out
of_his
mind_for
a_spell;
but_it
was_the
sharp_shooting
pains_in
his_bleeding
stump_that
brought_that
about,_as
any_one
might_see.
_I
know,_too,
that_ever
since_he
lost_his
leg_last
voyage_by
that_accursed
whale,_he's
been_a
kind_of
moody--desperate_moody,
and_savage
sometimes;_but
that_will
all_pass
off._
And_once
for_all,
let_me
tell_thee
and_assure
thee,_young
man,_it's
better_to
sail_with
a_moody
good_captain
than_a
laughing_bad
one._
So_good-bye
to_thee--and
wrong_not
Captain_Ahab,
because_he
happens_to
have_a
wicked_name.
_Besides,
my_boy,
he_has
a_wife--not
three_voyages
wedded--a_sweet,
resigned_girl.
_Think
of_that;
by_that
sweet_girl
that_old
man_has
a_child:
hold_ye
then_there
can_be
any_utter,
hopeless_harm
in_Ahab?
_No,
no,_my
lad;_stricken,
blasted,_if
he_be,
Ahab_has
his_humanities!"
_As
I_walked
away,_I
was_full
of_thoughtfulness;
what_had
been_incidentally
revealed_to
me_of
Captain_Ahab,
filled_me
with_a
certain_wild
vagueness_of
painfulness_concerning
him._
And_somehow,
at_the
time,_I
felt_a
sympathy_and
a_sorrow
for_him,
but_for
I_don't
know_what,
unless_it
was_the
cruel_loss
of_his
leg._
And_yet
I_also
felt_a
strange_awe
of_him;
but_that
sort_of
awe,_which
I_cannot
at_all
describe,_was
not_exactly
awe;_I
do_not
know_what
it_was.
_But
I_felt
it;_and
it_did
not_disincline
me_towards
him;_though
I_felt
impatience_at
what_seemed
like_mystery
in_him,
so_imperfectly
as_he
was_known
to_me
then._
However,_my
thoughts_were
at_length
carried_in
other_directions,
so_that
for_the
present_dark
Ahab_slipped
my_mind.
_
_CHAPTER
17_
The_Ramadan.
_
As_Queequeg's
Ramadan,_or
Fasting_and
Humiliation,_was
to_continue
all_day,
I_did
not_choose
to_disturb
him_till
towards_night-fall;
for_I
cherish_the
greatest_respect
towards_everybody's
religious_obligations,
never_mind
how_comical,
and_could
not_find
it_in
my_heart
to_undervalue
even_a
congregation_of
ants_worshipping
a_toad-stool;
or_those
other_creatures
in_certain
parts_of
our_earth,
who_with
a_degree
of_footmanism
quite_unprecedented
in_other
planets,_bow
down_before
the_torso
of_a
deceased_landed
proprietor_merely
on_account
of_the
inordinate_possessions
yet_owned
and_rented
in_his
name._
I_say,
we_good
Presbyterian_Christians
should_be
charitable_in
these_things,
and_not
fancy_ourselves
so_vastly
superior_to
other_mortals,
pagans_and
what_not,
because_of
their_half-crazy
conceits_on
these_subjects.
_There
was_Queequeg,
now,_certainly
entertaining_the
most_absurd
notions_about
Yojo_and
his_Ramadan;--but
what_of
that?_Queequeg
thought_he
knew_what
he_was
about,_I
suppose;_he
seemed_to
be_content;
and_there
let_him
rest._
All_our
arguing_with
him_would
not_avail;
let_him
be,_I
say:_and
Heaven_have
mercy_on
us_all--Presbyterians
and_Pagans
alike--for_we
are_all
somehow_dreadfully
cracked_about
the_head,
and_sadly
need_mending.
_Towards
evening,_when
I_felt
assured_that
all_his
performances_and
rituals_must
be_over,
I_went
up_to
his_room
and_knocked
at_the
door;_but
no_answer.
_I
tried_to
open_it,
but_it
was_fastened
inside._"Queequeg,"
said_I
softly_through
the_key-hole:--all
silent._
"I_say,
Queequeg!_why
don't_you
speak?_
It's_I--Ishmael."
_But
all_remained
still_as
before._
I_began
to_grow
alarmed._
I_had
allowed_him
such_abundant
time;_I
thought_he
might_have
had_an
apoplectic_fit.
_I
looked_through
the_key-hole;
but_the
door_opening
into_an
odd_corner
of_the
room,_the
key-hole_prospect
was_but
a_crooked
and_sinister
one._
I_could
only_see
part_of
the_foot-board
of_the
bed_and
a_line
of_the
wall,_but
nothing_more.
_I
was_surprised
to_behold
resting_against
the_wall
the_wooden
shaft_of
Queequeg's_harpoon,
which_the
landlady_the
evening_previous
had_taken
from_him,
before_our
mounting_to
the_chamber.
_That's
strange,_thought
I;_but
at_any
rate,_since
the_harpoon
stands_yonder,
and_he
seldom_or
never_goes
abroad_without
it,_therefore
he_must
be_inside
here,_and
no_possible
mistake._
"Queequeg!--Queequeg!"--all_still.
_Something
must_have
happened._Apoplexy!
_I
tried_to
burst_open
the_door;
but_it
stubbornly_resisted.
_Running
down_stairs,
I_quickly
stated_my
suspicions_to
the_first
person_I
met--the_chamber-maid.
_"La!
la!"_she
cried,_"I
thought_something
must_be
the_matter.
_I
went_to
make_the
bed_after
breakfast,_and
the_door
was_locked;
and_not
a_mouse
to_be
heard;_and
it's_been
just_so
silent_ever
since._
But_I
thought,_may
be,_you
had_both
gone_off
and_locked
your_baggage
in_for
safe_keeping.
_La!
la,_ma'am!--Mistress!
murder!_
Mrs._Hussey!
apoplexy!"--and_with
these_cries,
she_ran
towards_the
kitchen,_I
following._
Mrs._Hussey
soon_appeared,
with_a
mustard-pot_in
one_hand
and_a
vinegar-cruet_in
the_other,
having_just
broken_away
from_the
occupation_of
attending_to
the_castors,
and_scolding
her_little
black_boy
meantime._
"Wood-house!"_cried
I,_"which
way_to
it?_
Run_for
God's_sake,
and_fetch
something_to
pry_open
the_door--the
axe!--the_axe!
he's_had
a_stroke;
depend_upon
it!"--and_so
saying_I
was_unmethodically
rushing_up
stairs_again
empty-handed,_when
Mrs._Hussey
interposed_the
mustard-pot_and
vinegar-cruet,_and
the_entire
castor_of
her_countenance.
_"What's
the_matter
with_you,
young_man?"
_"Get
the_axe!
_For
God's_sake,
run_for
the_doctor,
some_one,
while_I
pry_it
open!"_
"Look_here,"
said_the
landlady,_quickly
putting_down
the_vinegar-cruet,
so_as
to_have
one_hand
free;_"look
here;_are
you_talking
about_prying
open_any
of_my
doors?"--and_with
that_she
seized_my
arm._
"What's_the
matter_with
you?_
What's_the
matter_with
you,_shipmate?"
_In
as_calm,
but_rapid
a_manner
as_possible,
I_gave
her_to
understand_the
whole_case.
_Unconsciously
clapping_the
vinegar-cruet_to
one_side
of_her
nose,_she
ruminated_for
an_instant;
then_exclaimed--"No!
_I
haven't_seen
it_since
I_put
it_there."
_Running
to_a
little_closet
under_the
landing_of
the_stairs,
she_glanced
in,_and
returning,_told
me_that
Queequeg's_harpoon
was_missing.
_"He's
killed_himself,"
she_cried.
_"It's
unfort'nate_Stiggs
done_over
again_there
goes_another
counterpane--God_pity
his_poor
mother!--it_will
be_the
ruin_of
my_house.
_Has
the_poor
lad_a
sister?_
Where's_that
girl?--there,_Betty,
go_to
Snarles_the
Painter,_and
tell_him
to_paint
me_a
sign,_with--"no
suicides_permitted
here,_and
no_smoking
in_the
parlor;"--might_as
well_kill
both_birds
at_once.
_Kill?
_The
Lord_be
merciful_to
his_ghost!
_What's
that_noise
there?_
You,_young
man,_avast
there!"_
And_running
up_after
me,_she
caught_me
as_I
was_again
trying_to
force_open
the_door.
_"I
don't_allow
it;_I
won't_have
my_premises
spoiled._
Go_for
the_locksmith,
there's_one
about_a
mile_from
here._
But_avast!"
putting_her
hand_in
her_side-pocket,
"here's_a
key_that'll
fit,_I
guess;_let's
see."_
And_with
that,_she
turned_it
in_the
lock;_but,
alas!_Queequeg's
supplemental_bolt
remained_unwithdrawn
within._
"Have_to
burst_it
open,"_said
I,_and
was_running
down_the
entry_a
little,_for
a_good
start,_when
the_landlady
caught_at
me,_again
vowing_I
should_not
break_down
her_premises;
but_I
tore_from
her,_and
with_a
sudden_bodily
rush_dashed
myself_full
against_the
mark._
With_a
prodigious_noise
the_door
flew_open,
and_the
knob_slamming
against_the
wall,_sent
the_plaster
to_the
ceiling;_and
there,_good
heavens!_there
sat_Queequeg,
altogether_cool
and_self-collected;
right_in
the_middle
of_the
room;_squatting
on_his
hams,_and
holding_Yojo
on_top
of_his
head._
He_looked
neither_one
way_nor
the_other
way,_but
sat_like
a_carved
image_with
scarce_a
sign_of
active_life.
_"Queequeg,"
said_I,
going_up
to_him,
"Queequeg,_what's
the_matter
with_you?"
_"He
hain't_been
a_sittin'
so_all
day,_has
he?"_said
the_landlady.
_But
all_we
said,_not
a_word
could_we
drag_out
of_him;
I_almost
felt_like
pushing_him
over,_so
as_to
change_his
position,_for
it_was
almost_intolerable,
it_seemed
so_painfully
and_unnaturally
constrained;_especially,
as_in
all_probability
he_had
been_sitting
so_for
upwards_of
eight_or
ten_hours,
going_too
without_his
regular_meals.
_"Mrs.
Hussey,"_said
I,_"he's
ALIVE_at
all_events;
so_leave
us,_if
you_please,
and_I
will_see
to_this
strange_affair
myself."_
Closing_the
door_upon
the_landlady,
I_endeavored
to_prevail
upon_Queequeg
to_take
a_chair;
but_in
vain._
There_he
sat;_and
all_he
could_do--for
all_my
polite_arts
and_blandishments--he
would_not
move_a
peg,_nor
say_a
single_word,
nor_even
look_at
me,_nor
notice_my
presence_in
the_slightest
way._
I_wonder,
thought_I,
if_this
can_possibly
be_a
part_of
his_Ramadan;
do_they
fast_on
their_hams
that_way
in_his
native_island.
_It
must_be
so;_yes,
it's_part
of_his
creed,_I
suppose;_well,
then,_let
him_rest;
he'll_get
up_sooner
or_later,
no_doubt.
_It
can't_last
for_ever,
thank_God,
and_his
Ramadan_only
comes_once
a_year;
and_I
don't_believe
it's_very
punctual_then.
_I
went_down
to_supper.
_After
sitting_a
long_time
listening_to
the_long
stories_of
some_sailors
who_had
just_come
from_a
plum-pudding_voyage,
as_they
called_it
(that_is,
a_short
whaling-voyage_in
a_schooner
or_brig,
confined_to
the_north
of_the
line,_in
the_Atlantic
Ocean_only);
after_listening
to_these
plum-puddingers_till
nearly_eleven
o'clock,_I
went_up
stairs_to
go_to
bed,_feeling
quite_sure
by_this
time_Queequeg
must_certainly
have_brought
his_Ramadan
to_a
termination._
But_no;
there_he
was_just
where_I
had_left
him;_he
had_not
stirred_an
inch._
I_began
to_grow
vexed_with
him;_it
seemed_so
downright_senseless
and_insane
to_be
sitting_there
all_day
and_half
the_night
on_his
hams_in
a_cold
room,_holding
a_piece
of_wood
on_his
head._
"For_heaven's
sake,_Queequeg,
get_up
and_shake
yourself;_get
up_and
have_some
supper._
You'll_starve;
you'll_kill
yourself,_Queequeg."
But_not
a_word
did_he
reply._
Despairing_of
him,_therefore,
I_determined
to_go
to_bed
and_to
sleep;_and
no_doubt,
before_a
great_while,
he_would
follow_me.
_But
previous_to
turning_in,
I_took
my_heavy
bearskin_jacket,
and_threw
it_over
him,_as
it_promised
to_be
a_very
cold_night;
and_he
had_nothing
but_his
ordinary_round
jacket_on.
_For
some_time,
do_all
I_would,
I_could
not_get
into_the
faintest_doze.
_I
had_blown
out_the
candle;_and
the_mere
thought_of
Queequeg--not_four
feet_off--sitting
there_in
that_uneasy
position,_stark
alone_in
the_cold
and_dark;
this_made
me_really
wretched._
Think_of
it;_sleeping
all_night
in_the
same_room
with_a
wide_awake
pagan_on
his_hams
in_this
dreary,_unaccountable
Ramadan!_
But_somehow
I_dropped
off_at
last,_and
knew_nothing
more_till
break_of
day;_when,
looking_over
the_bedside,
there_squatted
Queequeg,_as
if_he
had_been
screwed_down
to_the
floor._
But_as
soon_as
the_first
glimpse_of
sun_entered
the_window,
up_he
got,_with
stiff_and
grating_joints,
but_with
a_cheerful
look;_limped
towards_me
where_I
lay;_pressed
his_forehead
again_against
mine;_and
said_his
Ramadan_was
over._
Now,_as
I_before
hinted,_I
have_no
objection_to
any_person's
religion,_be
it_what
it_may,
so_long
as_that
person_does
not_kill
or_insult
any_other
person,_because
that_other
person_don't
believe_it
also._
But_when
a_man's
religion_becomes
really_frantic;
when_it
is_a
positive_torment
to_him;
and,_in
fine,_makes
this_earth
of_ours
an_uncomfortable
inn_to
lodge_in;
then_I
think_it
high_time
to_take
that_individual
aside_and
argue_the
point_with
him._
And_just
so_I
now_did
with_Queequeg.
_"Queequeg,"
said_I,
"get_into
bed_now,
and_lie
and_listen
to_me."
_I
then_went
on,_beginning
with_the
rise_and
progress_of
the_primitive
religions,_and
coming_down
to_the
various_religions
of_the
present_time,
during_which
time_I
labored_to
show_Queequeg
that_all
these_Lents,
Ramadans,_and
prolonged_ham-squattings
in_cold,
cheerless_rooms
were_stark
nonsense;_bad
for_the
health;_useless
for_the
soul;_opposed,
in_short,
to_the
obvious_laws
of_Hygiene
and_common
sense._
I_told
him,_too,
that_he
being_in
other_things
such_an
extremely_sensible
and_sagacious
savage,_it
pained_me,
very_badly
pained_me,
to_see
him_now
so_deplorably
foolish_about
this_ridiculous
Ramadan_of
his._
Besides,_argued
I,_fasting
makes_the
body_cave
in;_hence
the_spirit
caves_in;
and_all
thoughts_born
of_a
fast_must
necessarily_be
half-starved._This
is_the
reason_why
most_dyspeptic
religionists_cherish
such_melancholy
notions_about
their_hereafters.
_In
one_word,
Queequeg,_said
I,_rather
digressively;_hell
is_an
idea_first
born_on
an_undigested
apple-dumpling;_and
since_then
perpetuated_through
the_hereditary
dyspepsias_nurtured
by_Ramadans.
_I
then_asked
Queequeg_whether
he_himself
was_ever
troubled_with
dyspepsia;_expressing
the_idea
very_plainly,
so_that
he_could
take_it
in._
He_said
no;_only
upon_one
memorable_occasion.
_It
was_after
a_great
feast_given
by_his
father_the
king,_on
the_gaining
of_a
great_battle
wherein_fifty
of_the
enemy_had
been_killed
by_about
two_o'clock
in_the
afternoon,_and
all_cooked
and_eaten
that_very
evening._
"No_more,
Queequeg,"_said
I,_shuddering;
"that_will
do;"_for
I_knew
the_inferences
without_his
further_hinting
them._
I_had
seen_a
sailor_who
had_visited
that_very
island,_and
he_told
me_that
it_was
the_custom,
when_a
great_battle
had_been
gained_there,
to_barbecue
all_the
slain_in
the_yard
or_garden
of_the
victor;_and
then,_one
by_one,
they_were
placed_in
great_wooden
trenchers,_and
garnished_round
like_a
pilau,_with
breadfruit_and
cocoanuts;_and
with_some
parsley_in
their_mouths,
were_sent
round_with
the_victor's
compliments_to
all_his
friends,_just
as_though
these_presents
were_so
many_Christmas
turkeys._
After_all,
I_do
not_think
that_my
remarks_about
religion_made
much_impression
upon_Queequeg.
_Because,
in_the
first_place,
he_somehow
seemed_dull
of_hearing
on_that
important_subject,
unless_considered
from_his
own_point
of_view;
and,_in
the_second
place,_he
did_not
more_than
one_third
understand_me,
couch_my
ideas_simply
as_I
would;_and,
finally,_he
no_doubt
thought_he
knew_a
good_deal
more_about
the_true
religion_than
I_did.
_He
looked_at
me_with
a_sort
of_condescending
concern_and
compassion,_as
though_he
thought_it
a_great
pity_that
such_a
sensible_young
man_should
be_so
hopelessly_lost
to_evangelical
pagan_piety.
_At
last_we
rose_and
dressed;_and
Queequeg,_taking
a_prodigiously
hearty_breakfast
of_chowders
of_all
sorts,_so
that_the
landlady_should
not_make
much_profit
by_reason
of_his
Ramadan,_we
sallied_out
to_board
the_Pequod,
sauntering_along,
and_picking
our_teeth
with_halibut
bones._
_
CHAPTER_18
_His
Mark._
_As
we_were
walking_down
the_end
of_the
wharf_towards
the_ship,
Queequeg_carrying
his_harpoon,
Captain_Peleg
in_his
gruff_voice
loudly_hailed
us_from
his_wigwam,
saying_he
had_not
suspected_my
friend_was
a_cannibal,
and_furthermore
announcing_that
he_let
no_cannibals
on_board
that_craft,
unless_they
previously_produced
their_papers.
_"What
do_you
mean_by
that,_Captain
Peleg?"_said
I,_now
jumping_on
the_bulwarks,
and_leaving
my_comrade
standing_on
the_wharf.
_"I
mean,"_he
replied,_"he
must_show
his_papers."
_"Yes,"
said_Captain
Bildad_in
his_hollow
voice,_sticking
his_head
from_behind
Peleg's,_out
of_the
wigwam._
"He_must
show_that
he's_converted.
_Son
of_darkness,"
he_added,
turning_to
Queequeg,_"art
thou_at
present_in
communion_with
any_Christian
church?"_
"Why,"_said
I,_"he's
a_member
of_the
first_Congregational
Church."_Here
be_it
said,_that
many_tattooed
savages_sailing
in_Nantucket
ships_at
last_come
to_be
converted_into
the_churches.
_"First
Congregational_Church,"
cried_Bildad,
"what!_that
worships_in
Deacon_Deuteronomy
Coleman's_meeting-house?"
and_so
saying,_taking
out_his
spectacles,_he
rubbed_them
with_his
great_yellow
bandana_handkerchief,
and_putting
them_on
very_carefully,
came_out
of_the
wigwam,_and
leaning_stiffly
over_the
bulwarks,_took
a_good
long_look
at_Queequeg.
_"How
long_hath
he_been
a_member?"
he_then
said,_turning
to_me;
"not_very
long,_I
rather_guess,
young_man."
_"No,"
said_Peleg,
"and_he
hasn't_been
baptized_right
either,_or
it_would
have_washed
some_of
that_devil's
blue_off
his_face."
_"Do
tell,_now,"
cried_Bildad,
"is_this
Philistine_a
regular_member
of_Deacon
Deuteronomy's_meeting?
_I
never_saw
him_going
there,_and
I_pass
it_every
Lord's_day."
_"I
don't_know
anything_about
Deacon_Deuteronomy
or_his
meeting,"_said
I;_"all
I_know
is,_that
Queequeg_here
is_a
born_member
of_the
First_Congregational
Church._
He_is
a_deacon
himself,_Queequeg
is."_
"Young_man,"
said_Bildad
sternly,_"thou
art_skylarking
with_me--explain
thyself,_thou
young_Hittite.
_What
church_dost
thee_mean?
answer_me."
_Finding
myself_thus
hard_pushed,
I_replied.
_"I
mean,_sir,
the_same
ancient_Catholic
Church_to
which_you
and_I,
and_Captain
Peleg_there,
and_Queequeg
here,_and
all_of
us,_and
every_mother's
son_and
soul_of
us_belong;
the_great
and_everlasting
First_Congregation
of_this
whole_worshipping
world;_we
all_belong
to_that;
only_some
of_us
cherish_some
queer_crotchets
no_ways
touching_the
grand_belief;
in_THAT
we_all
join_hands."
_"Splice,
thou_mean'st
SPLICE_hands,"
cried_Peleg,
drawing_nearer.
"Young_man,
you'd_better
ship_for
a_missionary,
instead_of
a_fore-mast
hand;_I
never_heard
a_better
sermon._
Deacon_Deuteronomy--why
Father_Mapple
himself_couldn't
beat_it,
and_he's
reckoned_something.
_Come
aboard,_come
aboard;_never
mind_about
the_papers.
_I
say,_tell
Quohog_there--what's
that_you
call_him?
tell_Quohog
to_step
along._
By_the
great_anchor,
what_a
harpoon_he's
got_there!
looks_like
good_stuff
that;_and
he_handles
it_about
right._
I_say,
Quohog,_or
whatever_your
name_is,
did_you
ever_stand
in_the
head_of
a_whale-boat?
did_you
ever_strike
a_fish?"
_Without
saying_a
word,_Queequeg,
in_his
wild_sort
of_way,
jumped_upon
the_bulwarks,
from_thence
into_the
bows_of
one_of
the_whale-boats
hanging_to
the_side;
and_then
bracing_his
left_knee,
and_poising
his_harpoon,
cried_out
in_some
such_way
as_this:--
_"Cap'ain,
you_see
him_small
drop_tar
on_water
dere?_
You_see
him?_well,
spose_him
one_whale
eye,_well,
den!"_and
taking_sharp
aim_at
it,_he
darted_the
iron_right
over_old
Bildad's_broad
brim,_clean
across_the
ship's_decks,
and_struck
the_glistening
tar_spot
out_of
sight._
"Now,"_said
Queequeg,_quietly
hauling_in
the_line,
"spos-ee_him
whale-e_eye;
why,_dad
whale_dead."
_"Quick,
Bildad,"_said
Peleg,_his
partner,_who,
aghast_at
the_close
vicinity_of
the_flying
harpoon,_had
retreated_towards
the_cabin
gangway._
"Quick,_I
say,_you
Bildad,_and
get_the
ship's_papers.
_We
must_have
Hedgehog_there,
I_mean
Quohog,_in
one_of
our_boats.
_Look
ye,_Quohog,
we'll_give
ye_the
ninetieth_lay,
and_that's
more_than
ever_was
given_a
harpooneer_yet
out_of
Nantucket."_
So_down
we_went
into_the
cabin,_and
to_my
great_joy
Queequeg_was
soon_enrolled
among_the
same_ship's
company_to
which_I
myself_belonged.
_When
all_preliminaries
were_over
and_Peleg
had_got
everything_ready
for_signing,
he_turned
to_me
and_said,
"I_guess,
Quohog_there
don't_know
how_to
write,_does
he?_
I_say,
Quohog,_blast
ye!_dost
thou_sign
thy_name
or_make
thy_mark?
_But
at_this
question,_Queequeg,
who_had
twice_or
thrice_before
taken_part
in_similar
ceremonies,_looked
no_ways
abashed;_but
taking_the
offered_pen,
copied_upon
the_paper,
in_the
proper_place,
an_exact
counterpart_of
a_queer
round_figure
which_was
tattooed_upon
his_arm;
so_that
through_Captain
Peleg's_obstinate
mistake_touching
his_appellative,
it_stood
something_like
this:--_
Quohog._his
X_mark.
_Meanwhile
Captain_Bildad
sat_earnestly
and_steadfastly
eyeing_Queequeg,
and_at
last_rising
solemnly_and
fumbling_in
the_huge
pockets_of
his_broad-skirted
drab_coat,
took_out
a_bundle
of_tracts,
and_selecting
one_entitled
"The_Latter
Day_Coming;
or_No
Time_to
Lose,"_placed
it_in
Queequeg's_hands,
and_then
grasping_them
and_the
book_with
both_his,
looked_earnestly
into_his
eyes,_and
said,_"Son
of_darkness,
I_must
do_my
duty_by
thee;_I
am_part
owner_of
this_ship,
and_feel
concerned_for
the_souls
of_all
its_crew;
if_thou
still_clingest
to_thy
Pagan_ways,
which_I
sadly_fear,
I_beseech
thee,_remain
not_for
aye_a
Belial_bondsman.
_Spurn
the_idol
Bell,_and
the_hideous
dragon;_turn
from_the
wrath_to
come;_mind
thine_eye,
I_say;
oh!_goodness
gracious!_steer
clear_of
the_fiery
pit!"_
Something_of
the_salt
sea_yet
lingered_in
old_Bildad's
language,_heterogeneously
mixed_with
Scriptural_and
domestic_phrases.
_"Avast
there,_avast
there,_Bildad,
avast_now
spoiling_our
harpooneer,"_Peleg.
_"Pious
harpooneers_never
make_good
voyagers--it_takes
the_shark
out_of
'em;_no
harpooneer_is
worth_a
straw_who
aint_pretty
sharkish._
There_was
young_Nat
Swaine,_once
the_bravest
boat-header_out
of_all
Nantucket_and
the_Vineyard;
he_joined
the_meeting,
and_never
came_to
good._
He_got
so_frightened
about_his
plaguy_soul,
that_he
shrinked_and
sheered_away
from_whales,
for_fear
of_after-claps,
in_case
he_got
stove_and
went_to
Davy_Jones."
_"Peleg!
_Peleg!"
said_Bildad,
lifting_his
eyes_and
hands,_"thou
thyself,_as
I_myself,
hast_seen
many_a
perilous_time;
thou_knowest,
Peleg,_what
it_is
to_have
the_fear
of_death;
how,_then,
can'st_thou
prate_in
this_ungodly
guise._
Thou_beliest
thine_own
heart,_Peleg.
Tell_me,
when_this
same_Pequod
here_had
her_three
masts_overboard
in_that
typhoon_on
Japan,_that
same_voyage
when_thou
went_mate
with_Captain
Ahab,_did'st
thou_not
think_of
Death_and
the_Judgment
then?"_
"Hear_him,
hear_him
now,"_cried
Peleg,_marching
across_the
cabin,_and
thrusting_his
hands_far
down_into
his_pockets,--"hear
him,_all
of_ye.
Think_of
that!_
When_every
moment_we
thought_the
ship_would
sink!_Death
and_the
Judgment_then?
_What?
_With
all_three
masts_making
such_an
everlasting_thundering
against_the
side;_and
every_sea
breaking_over
us,_fore
and_aft.
_Think
of_Death
and_the
Judgment_then?
_No!
no_time
to_think
about_Death
then._
Life_was
what_Captain
Ahab_and
I_was
thinking_of;
and_how
to_save
all_hands--how
to_rig
jury-masts--how_to
get_into
the_nearest
port;_that
was_what
I_was
thinking_of."
_Bildad
said_no
more,_but
buttoning_up
his_coat,
stalked_on
deck,_where
we_followed
him._
There_he
stood,_very
quietly_overlooking
some_sailmakers
who_were
mending_a
top-sail_in
the_waist.
_Now
and_then
he_stooped
to_pick
up_a
patch,_or
save_an
end_of
tarred_twine,
which_otherwise
might_have
been_wasted.
_
_CHAPTER
19_
The_Prophet.
_
"Shipmates,_have
ye_shipped
in_that
ship?"_
Queequeg_and
I_had
just_left
the_Pequod,
and_were
sauntering_away
from_the
water,_for
the_moment
each_occupied
with_his
own_thoughts,
when_the
above_words
were_put
to_us
by_a
stranger,_who,
pausing_before
us,_levelled
his_massive
forefinger_at
the_vessel
in_question.
_He
was_but
shabbily_apparelled
in_faded
jacket_and
patched_trowsers;
a_rag
of_a
black_handkerchief
investing_his
neck._
A_confluent
small-pox_had
in_all
directions_flowed
over_his
face,_and
left_it
like_the
complicated_ribbed
bed_of
a_torrent,
when_the
rushing_waters
have_been
dried_up.
_"Have
ye_shipped
in_her?"
he_repeated.
_"You
mean_the
ship_Pequod,
I_suppose,"
said_I,
trying_to
gain_a
little_more
time_for
an_uninterrupted
look_at
him._
"Aye,_the
Pequod--that_ship
there,"_he
said,_drawing
back_his
whole_arm,
and_then
rapidly_shoving
it_straight
out_from
him,_with
the_fixed
bayonet_of
his_pointed
finger_darted
full_at
the_object.
_"Yes,"
said_I,
"we_have
just_signed
the_articles."
_"Anything
down_there
about_your
souls?"_
"About_what?"
_"Oh,
perhaps_you
hav'n't_got
any,"_he
said_quickly.
_"No
matter_though,
I_know
many_chaps
that_hav'n't
got_any,--good
luck_to
'em;_and
they_are
all_the
better_off
for_it.
_A
soul's_a
sort_of
a_fifth
wheel_to
a_wagon."
_"What
are_you
jabbering_about,
shipmate?"_said
I._
"HE'S_got
enough,_though,
to_make
up_for
all_deficiencies
of_that
sort_in
other_chaps,"
abruptly_said
the_stranger,
placing_a
nervous_emphasis
upon_the
word_HE.
_"Queequeg,"
said_I,
"let's_go;
this_fellow
has_broken
loose_from
somewhere;_he's
talking_about
something_and
somebody_we
don't_know."
_"Stop!"
cried_the
stranger._
"Ye_said
true--ye_hav'n't
seen_Old
Thunder_yet,
have_ye?"
_"Who's
Old_Thunder?"
said_I,
again_riveted
with_the
insane_earnestness
of_his
manner._
"Captain_Ahab."
_"What!
the_captain
of_our
ship,_the
Pequod?"_
"Aye,_among
some_of
us_old
sailor_chaps,
he_goes
by_that
name._
Ye_hav'n't
seen_him
yet,_have
ye?"_
"No,_we
hav'n't._
He's_sick
they_say,
but_is
getting_better,
and_will
be_all
right_again
before_long."
_"All
right_again
before_long!"
laughed_the
stranger,_with
a_solemnly
derisive_sort
of_laugh.
_"Look
ye;_when
Captain_Ahab
is_all
right,_then
this_left
arm_of
mine_will
be_all
right;_not
before."_
"What_do
you_know
about_him?"
_"What
did_they
TELL_you
about_him?
_Say
that!"_
"They_didn't
tell_much
of_anything
about_him;
only_I've
heard_that
he's_a
good_whale-hunter,
and_a
good_captain
to_his
crew."_
"That's_true,
that's_true--yes,
both_true
enough._
But_you
must_jump
when_he
gives_an
order._
Step_and
growl;_growl
and_go--that's
the_word
with_Captain
Ahab._
But_nothing
about_that
thing_that
happened_to
him_off
Cape_Horn,
long_ago,
when_he
lay_like
dead_for
three_days
and_nights;
nothing_about
that_deadly
skrimmage_with
the_Spaniard
afore_the
altar_in
Santa?--heard_nothing
about_that,
eh?_
Nothing_about
the_silver
calabash_he
spat_into?
_And
nothing_about
his_losing
his_leg
last_voyage,
according_to
the_prophecy.
_Didn't
ye_hear
a_word
about_them
matters_and
something_more,
eh?_
No,_I
don't_think
ye_did;
how_could
ye?_
Who_knows
it?_
Not_all
Nantucket,_I
guess._
But_hows'ever,
mayhap,_ye've
heard_tell
about_the
leg,_and
how_he
lost_it;
aye,_ye
have_heard
of_that,
I_dare
say._
Oh_yes,
THAT_every
one_knows
a'most--I_mean
they_know
he's_only
one_leg;
and_that
a_parmacetti
took_the
other_off."
_"My
friend,"_said
I,_"what
all_this
gibberish_of
yours_is
about,_I
don't_know,
and_I
don't_much
care;_for
it_seems
to_me
that_you
must_be
a_little
damaged_in
the_head.
_But
if_you
are_speaking
of_Captain
Ahab,_of
that_ship
there,_the
Pequod,_then
let_me
tell_you,
that_I
know_all
about_the
loss_of
his_leg."
_"ALL
about_it,
eh--sure_you
do?--all?"_
"Pretty_sure."
_With
finger_pointed
and_eye
levelled_at
the_Pequod,
the_beggar-like
stranger_stood
a_moment,
as_if
in_a
troubled_reverie;
then_starting
a_little,
turned_and
said:--"Ye've_shipped,
have_ye?
_Names
down_on
the_papers?
_Well,
well,_what's
signed,_is
signed;_and
what's_to
be,_will
be;_and
then_again,
perhaps_it
won't_be,
after_all.
_Anyhow,
it's_all
fixed_and
arranged_a'ready;
and_some
sailors_or
other_must
go_with
him,_I
suppose;_as
well_these
as_any
other_men,
God_pity
'em!_Morning
to_ye,
shipmates,_morning;
the_ineffable
heavens_bless
ye;_I'm
sorry_I
stopped_ye."
_"Look
here,_friend,"
said_I,
"if_you
have_anything
important_to
tell_us,
out_with
it;_but
if_you
are_only
trying_to
bamboozle_us,
you_are
mistaken_in
your_game;
that's_all
I_have
to_say."
_"And
it's_said
very_well,
and_I
like_to
hear_a
chap_talk
up_that
way;_you
are_just
the_man
for_him--the
likes_of
ye._
Morning_to
ye,_shipmates,
morning!_
Oh!_when
ye_get
there,_tell
'em_I've
concluded_not
to_make
one_of
'em."_
"Ah,_my
dear_fellow,
you_can't
fool_us
that_way--you
can't_fool
us._It
is_the
easiest_thing
in_the
world_for
a_man
to_look
as_if
he_had
a_great
secret_in
him."_
"Morning_to
ye,_shipmates,
morning."_
"Morning_it
is,"_said
I._
"Come_along,
Queequeg,_let's
leave_this
crazy_man.
_But
stop,_tell
me_your
name,_will
you?"_
"Elijah."_
Elijah!_thought
I,_and
we_walked
away,_both
commenting,_after
each_other's
fashion,_upon
this_ragged
old_sailor;
and_agreed
that_he
was_nothing
but_a
humbug,_trying
to_be
a_bugbear.
_But
we_had
not_gone
perhaps_above
a_hundred
yards,_when
chancing_to
turn_a
corner,_and
looking_back
as_I
did_so,
who_should
be_seen
but_Elijah
following_us,
though_at
a_distance.
_Somehow,
the_sight
of_him
struck_me
so,_that
I_said
nothing_to
Queequeg_of
his_being
behind,_but
passed_on
with_my
comrade,_anxious
to_see
whether_the
stranger_would
turn_the
same_corner
that_we
did._
He_did;
and_then
it_seemed
to_me
that_he
was_dogging
us,_but
with_what
intent_I
could_not
for_the
life_of
me_imagine.
_This
circumstance,_coupled
with_his
ambiguous,_half-hinting,
half-revealing,_shrouded
sort_of
talk,_now
begat_in
me_all
kinds_of
vague_wonderments
and_half-apprehensions,
and_all
connected_with
the_Pequod;
and_Captain
Ahab;_and
the_leg
he_had
lost;_and
the_Cape
Horn_fit;
and_the
silver_calabash;
and_what
Captain_Peleg
had_said
of_him,
when_I
left_the
ship_the
day_previous;
and_the
prediction_of
the_squaw
Tistig;_and
the_voyage
we_had
bound_ourselves
to_sail;
and_a
hundred_other
shadowy_things.
_I
was_resolved
to_satisfy
myself_whether
this_ragged
Elijah_was
really_dogging
us_or
not,_and
with_that
intent_crossed
the_way
with_Queequeg,
and_on
that_side
of_it
retraced_our
steps._
But_Elijah
passed_on,
without_seeming
to_notice
us._
This_relieved
me;_and
once_more,
and_finally
as_it
seemed_to
me,_I
pronounced_him
in_my
heart,_a
humbug._
_
CHAPTER_20
_All
Astir._
_A
day_or
two_passed,
and_there
was_great
activity_aboard
the_Pequod.
Not_only
were_the
old_sails
being_mended,
but_new
sails_were
coming_on
board,_and
bolts_of
canvas,_and
coils_of
rigging;_in
short,_everything
betokened_that
the_ship's
preparations_were
hurrying_to
a_close.
_Captain
Peleg_seldom
or_never
went_ashore,
but_sat
in_his
wigwam_keeping
a_sharp
look-out_upon
the_hands:
Bildad_did
all_the
purchasing_and
providing_at
the_stores;
and_the
men_employed
in_the
hold_and
on_the
rigging_were
working_till
long_after
night-fall._
On_the
day_following
Queequeg's_signing
the_articles,
word_was
given_at
all_the
inns_where
the_ship's
company_were
stopping,_that
their_chests
must_be
on_board
before_night,
for_there
was_no
telling_how
soon_the
vessel_might
be_sailing.
_So
Queequeg_and
I_got
down_our
traps,_resolving,
however,_to
sleep_ashore
till_the
last._
But_it
seems_they
always_give
very_long
notice_in
these_cases,
and_the
ship_did
not_sail
for_several
days._
But_no
wonder;_there
was_a
good_deal
to_be
done,_and
there_is
no_telling
how_many
things_to
be_thought
of,_before
the_Pequod
was_fully
equipped._
Every_one
knows_what
a_multitude
of_things--beds,
sauce-pans,_knives
and_forks,
shovels_and
tongs,_napkins,
nut-crackers,_and
what_not,
are_indispensable
to_the
business_of
housekeeping._
Just_so
with_whaling,
which_necessitates
a_three-years'
housekeeping_upon
the_wide
ocean,_far
from_all
grocers,_costermongers,
doctors,_bakers,
and_bankers.
_And
though_this
also_holds
true_of
merchant_vessels,
yet_not
by_any
means_to
the_same
extent_as
with_whalemen.
_For
besides_the
great_length
of_the
whaling_voyage,
the_numerous
articles_peculiar
to_the
prosecution_of
the_fishery,
and_the
impossibility_of
replacing_them
at_the
remote_harbors
usually_frequented,
it_must
be_remembered,
that_of
all_ships,
whaling_vessels
are_the
most_exposed
to_accidents
of_all
kinds,_and
especially_to
the_destruction
and_loss
of_the
very_things
upon_which
the_success
of_the
voyage_most
depends._Hence,
the_spare
boats,_spare
spars,_and
spare_lines
and_harpoons,
and_spare
everythings,_almost,
but_a
spare_Captain
and_duplicate
ship._
At_the
period_of
our_arrival
at_the
Island,_the
heaviest_storage
of_the
Pequod_had
been_almost
completed;_comprising
her_beef,
bread,_water,
fuel,_and
iron_hoops
and_staves.
_But,
as_before
hinted,_for
some_time
there_was
a_continual
fetching_and
carrying_on
board_of
divers_odds
and_ends
of_things,
both_large
and_small.
_Chief
among_those
who_did
this_fetching
and_carrying
was_Captain
Bildad's_sister,
a_lean
old_lady
of_a
most_determined
and_indefatigable
spirit,_but
withal_very
kindhearted,_who
seemed_resolved
that,_if
SHE_could
help_it,
nothing_should
be_found
wanting_in
the_Pequod,
after_once
fairly_getting
to_sea.
_At
one_time
she_would
come_on
board_with
a_jar
of_pickles
for_the
steward's_pantry;
another_time
with_a
bunch_of
quills_for
the_chief
mate's_desk,
where_he
kept_his
log;_a
third_time
with_a
roll_of
flannel_for
the_small
of_some
one's_rheumatic
back._
Never_did
any_woman
better_deserve
her_name,
which_was
Charity--Aunt_Charity,
as_everybody
called_her.
_And
like_a
sister_of
charity_did
this_charitable
Aunt_Charity
bustle_about
hither_and
thither,_ready
to_turn
her_hand
and_heart
to_anything
that_promised
to_yield
safety,_comfort,
and_consolation
to_all
on_board
a_ship
in_which
her_beloved
brother_Bildad
was_concerned,
and_in
which_she
herself_owned
a_score
or_two
of_well-saved
dollars._
But_it
was_startling
to_see
this_excellent
hearted_Quakeress
coming_on
board,_as
she_did
the_last
day,_with
a_long
oil-ladle_in
one_hand,
and_a
still_longer
whaling_lance
in_the
other._
Nor_was
Bildad_himself
nor_Captain
Peleg_at
all_backward.
_As
for_Bildad,
he_carried
about_with
him_a
long_list
of_the
articles_needed,
and_at
every_fresh
arrival,_down
went_his
mark_opposite
that_article
upon_the
paper._Every
once_in
a_while
Peleg_came
hobbling_out
of_his
whalebone_den,
roaring_at
the_men
down_the
hatchways,_roaring
up_to
the_riggers
at_the
mast-head,_and
then_concluded
by_roaring
back_into
his_wigwam.
_During
these_days
of_preparation,
Queequeg_and
I_often
visited_the
craft,_and
as_often
I_asked
about_Captain
Ahab,_and
how_he
was,_and
when_he
was_going
to_come
on_board
his_ship.
_To
these_questions
they_would
answer,_that
he_was
getting_better
and_better,
and_was
expected_aboard
every_day;
meantime,_the
two_captains,
Peleg_and
Bildad,_could
attend_to
everything_necessary
to_fit
the_vessel
for_the
voyage._
If_I
had_been
downright_honest
with_myself,
I_would
have_seen
very_plainly
in_my
heart_that
I_did
but_half
fancy_being
committed_this
way_to
so_long
a_voyage,
without_once
laying_my
eyes_on
the_man
who_was
to_be
the_absolute
dictator_of
it,_so
soon_as
the_ship
sailed_out
upon_the
open_sea.
_But
when_a
man_suspects
any_wrong,
it_sometimes
happens_that
if_he
be_already
involved_in
the_matter,
he_insensibly
strives_to
cover_up
his_suspicions
even_from
himself._
And_much
this_way
it_was
with_me.
_I
said_nothing,
and_tried
to_think
nothing._
At_last
it_was
given_out
that_some
time_next
day_the
ship_would
certainly_sail.
_So
next_morning,
Queequeg_and
I_took
a_very
early_start.
_
_CHAPTER
21_
Going_Aboard.
_
It_was
nearly_six
o'clock,_but
only_grey
imperfect_misty
dawn,_when
we_drew
nigh_the
wharf._
"There_are
some_sailors
running_ahead
there,_if
I_see
right,"_said
I_to
Queequeg,_"it
can't_be
shadows;_she's
off_by
sunrise,_I
guess;_come
on!"_
"Avast!"_cried
a_voice,
whose_owner
at_the
same_time
coming_close
behind_us,
laid_a
hand_upon
both_our
shoulders,_and
then_insinuating
himself_between
us,_stood
stooping_forward
a_little,
in_the
uncertain_twilight,
strangely_peering
from_Queequeg
to_me.
_It
was_Elijah.
_"Going
aboard?"_
"Hands_off,
will_you,"
said_I.
_"Lookee
here,"_said
Queequeg,_shaking
himself,_"go
'way!"_
"Ain't_going
aboard,_then?"
_"Yes,
we_are,"
said_I,
"but_what
business_is
that_of
yours?_
Do_you
know,_Mr.
Elijah,_that
I_consider
you_a
little_impertinent?"
_"No,
no,_no;
I_wasn't
aware_of
that,"_said
Elijah,_slowly
and_wonderingly
looking_from
me_to
Queequeg,_with
the_most
unaccountable_glances.
_"Elijah,"
said_I,
"you_will
oblige_my
friend_and
me_by
withdrawing._We
are_going
to_the
Indian_and
Pacific_Oceans,
and_would
prefer_not
to_be
detained."_
"Ye_be,
be_ye?
_Coming
back_afore
breakfast?"_
"He's_cracked,
Queequeg,"_said
I,_"come
on."_
"Holloa!"_cried
stationary_Elijah,
hailing_us
when_we
had_removed
a_few
paces._
"Never_mind
him,"_said
I,_"Queequeg,
come_on."
_But
he_stole
up_to
us_again,
and_suddenly
clapping_his
hand_on
my_shoulder,
said--"Did_ye
see_anything
looking_like
men_going
towards_that
ship_a
while_ago?"
_Struck
by_this
plain_matter-of-fact
question,_I
answered,_saying,
"Yes,_I
thought_I
did_see
four_or
five_men;
but_it
was_too
dim_to
be_sure."
_"Very
dim,_very
dim,"_said
Elijah._
"Morning_to
ye."_
Once_more
we_quitted
him;_but
once_more
he_came
softly_after
us;_and
touching_my
shoulder_again,
said,_"See
if_you
can_find
'em_now,
will_ye?
_"Find
who?"_
"Morning_to
ye!_morning
to_ye!"
he_rejoined,
again_moving
off._
"Oh!_I
was_going
to_warn
ye_against--but
never_mind,
never_mind--it's
all_one,
all_in
the_family
too;--sharp_frost
this_morning,
ain't_it?
Good-bye_to
ye._
Shan't_see
ye_again
very_soon,
I_guess;
unless_it's
before_the
Grand_Jury."
_And
with_these
cracked_words
he_finally
departed,_leaving
me,_for
the_moment,
in_no
small_wonderment
at_his
frantic_impudence.
_At
last,_stepping
on_board
the_Pequod,
we_found
everything_in
profound_quiet,
not_a
soul_moving.
_The
cabin_entrance
was_locked
within;_the
hatches_were
all_on,
and_lumbered
with_coils
of_rigging.
Going_forward
to_the
forecastle,_we
found_the
slide_of
the_scuttle
open._
Seeing_a
light,_we
went_down,
and_found
only_an
old_rigger
there,_wrapped
in_a
tattered_pea-jacket.
_He
was_thrown
at_whole
length_upon
two_chests,
his_face
downwards_and
inclosed_in
his_folded
arms._
The_profoundest
slumber_slept
upon_him.
_"Those
sailors_we
saw,_Queequeg,
where_can
they_have
gone_to?"
said_I,
looking_dubiously
at_the
sleeper._
But_it
seemed_that,
when_on
the_wharf,
Queequeg_had
not_at
all_noticed
what_I
now_alluded
to;_hence
I_would
have_thought
myself_to
have_been
optically_deceived
in_that
matter,_were
it_not
for_Elijah's
otherwise_inexplicable
question._But
I_beat
the_thing
down;_and
again_marking
the_sleeper,
jocularly_hinted
to_Queequeg
that_perhaps
we_had
best_sit
up_with
the_body;
telling_him
to_establish
himself_accordingly.
_He
put_his
hand_upon
the_sleeper's
rear,_as
though_feeling
if_it
was_soft
enough;_and
then,_without
more_ado,
sat_quietly
down_there.
_"Gracious!
_Queequeg,
don't_sit
there,"_said
I._
"Oh!_perry
dood_seat,"
said_Queequeg,
"my_country
way;_won't
hurt_him
face."_
"Face!"_said
I,_"call
that_his
face?_very
benevolent_countenance
then;_but
how_hard
he_breathes,
he's_heaving
himself;_get
off,_Queequeg,
you_are
heavy,_it's
grinding_the
face_of
the_poor.
_Get
off,_Queequeg!
_Look,
he'll_twitch
you_off
soon._
I_wonder
he_don't
wake."_
Queequeg_removed
himself_to
just_beyond
the_head
of_the
sleeper,_and
lighted_his
tomahawk_pipe.
_I
sat_at
the_feet.
_We
kept_the
pipe_passing
over_the
sleeper,_from
one_to
the_other.
_Meanwhile,
upon_questioning
him_in
his_broken
fashion,_Queequeg
gave_me
to_understand
that,_in
his_land,
owing_to
the_absence
of_settees
and_sofas
of_all
sorts,_the
king,_chiefs,
and_great
people_generally,
were_in
the_custom
of_fattening
some_of
the_lower
orders_for
ottomans;_and
to_furnish
a_house
comfortably_in
that_respect,
you_had
only_to
buy_up
eight_or
ten_lazy
fellows,_and
lay_them
round_in
the_piers
and_alcoves.
_Besides,
it_was
very_convenient
on_an
excursion;_much
better_than
those_garden-chairs
which_are
convertible_into
walking-sticks;_upon
occasion,_a
chief_calling
his_attendant,
and_desiring
him_to
make_a
settee_of
himself_under
a_spreading
tree,_perhaps
in_some
damp_marshy
place._
While_narrating
these_things,
every_time
Queequeg_received
the_tomahawk
from_me,
he_flourished
the_hatchet-side
of_it
over_the
sleeper's_head.
_"What's
that_for,
Queequeg?"_
"Perry_easy,
kill-e;_oh!
perry_easy!
_He
was_going
on_with
some_wild
reminiscences_about
his_tomahawk-pipe,
which,_it
seemed,_had
in_its
two_uses
both_brained
his_foes
and_soothed
his_soul,
when_we
were_directly
attracted_to
the_sleeping
rigger._
The_strong
vapour_now
completely_filling
the_contracted
hole,_it
began_to
tell_upon
him._
He_breathed
with_a
sort_of
muffledness;_then
seemed_troubled
in_the
nose;_then
revolved_over
once_or
twice;_then
sat_up
and_rubbed
his_eyes.
_"Holloa!"
he_breathed
at_last,
"who_be
ye_smokers?"
_"Shipped
men,"_answered
I,_"when
does_she
sail?"_
"Aye,_aye,
ye_are
going_in
her,_be
ye?_
She_sails
to-day._
The_Captain
came_aboard
last_night."
_"What
Captain?--Ahab?"_
"Who_but
him_indeed?"
_I
was_going
to_ask
him_some
further_questions
concerning_Ahab,
when_we
heard_a
noise_on
deck._
"Holloa!_
Starbuck's_astir,"
said_the
rigger._
"He's_a
lively_chief
mate,_that;
good_man,
and_a
pious;_but
all_alive
now,_I
must_turn
to."_
And_so
saying_he
went_on
deck,_and
we_followed.
_It
was_now
clear_sunrise.
_Soon
the_crew
came_on
board_in
twos_and
threes;_the
riggers_bestirred
themselves;_the
mates_were
actively_engaged;
and_several
of_the
shore_people
were_busy
in_bringing
various_last
things_on
board._
Meanwhile_Captain
Ahab_remained
invisibly_enshrined
within_his
cabin._
_
CHAPTER_22
_Merry
Christmas._
_At
length,_towards
noon,_upon
the_final
dismissal_of
the_ship's
riggers,_and
after_the
Pequod_had
been_hauled
out_from
the_wharf,
and_after
the_ever-thoughtful
Charity_had
come_off
in_a
whale-boat,_with
her_last
gift--a_night-cap
for_Stubb,
the_second
mate,_her
brother-in-law,_and
a_spare
Bible_for
the_steward--after
all_this,
the_two
Captains,_Peleg
and_Bildad,
issued_from
the_cabin,
and_turning
to_the
chief_mate,
Peleg_said:
_"Now,
Mr._Starbuck,
are_you
sure_everything
is_right?
_Captain
Ahab_is
all_ready--just
spoke_to
him--nothing_more
to_be
got_from
shore,_eh?
_Well,
call_all
hands,_then.
_Muster
'em_aft
here--blast_'em!"
_"No
need_of
profane_words,
however_great
the_hurry,
Peleg,"_said
Bildad,_"but
away_with
thee,_friend
Starbuck,_and
do_our
bidding."_
How_now!
_Here
upon_the
very_point
of_starting
for_the
voyage,_Captain
Peleg_and
Captain_Bildad
were_going
it_with
a_high
hand_on
the_quarter-deck,
just_as
if_they
were_to
be_joint-commanders
at_sea,
as_well
as_to
all_appearances
in_port.
_And,
as_for
Captain_Ahab,
no_sign
of_him
was_yet
to_be
seen;_only,
they_said
he_was
in_the
cabin._But
then,_the
idea_was,
that_his
presence_was
by_no
means_necessary
in_getting
the_ship
under_weigh,
and_steering
her_well
out_to
sea._Indeed,
as_that
was_not
at_all
his_proper
business,_but
the_pilot's;
and_as
he_was
not_yet
completely_recovered--so
they_said--therefore,
Captain_Ahab
stayed_below.
_And
all_this
seemed_natural
enough;_especially
as_in
the_merchant
service_many
captains_never
show_themselves
on_deck
for_a
considerable_time
after_heaving
up_the
anchor,_but
remain_over
the_cabin
table,_having
a_farewell
merry-making_with
their_shore
friends,_before
they_quit
the_ship
for_good
with_the
pilot._
But_there
was_not
much_chance
to_think
over_the
matter,_for
Captain_Peleg
was_now
all_alive.
_He
seemed_to
do_most
of_the
talking_and
commanding,_and
not_Bildad.
_"Aft
here,_ye
sons_of
bachelors,"_he
cried,_as
the_sailors
lingered_at
the_main-mast.
_"Mr.
Starbuck,_drive'em
aft."_
"Strike_the
tent_there!"--was
the_next
order._
As_I
hinted_before,
this_whalebone
marquee_was
never_pitched
except_in
port;_and
on_board
the_Pequod,
for_thirty
years,_the
order_to
strike_the
tent_was
well_known
to_be
the_next
thing_to
heaving_up
the_anchor.
_"Man
the_capstan!
_Blood
and_thunder!--jump!"--was
the_next
command,_and
the_crew
sprang_for
the_handspikes.
_Now
in_getting
under_weigh,
the_station
generally_occupied
by_the
pilot_is
the_forward
part_of
the_ship.
_And
here_Bildad,
who,_with
Peleg,_be
it_known,
in_addition
to_his
other_officers,
was_one
of_the
licensed_pilots
of_the
port--he_being
suspected_to
have_got
himself_made
a_pilot
in_order
to_save
the_Nantucket
pilot-fee_to
all_the
ships_he
was_concerned
in,_for
he_never
piloted_any
other_craft--Bildad,
I_say,
might_now
be_seen
actively_engaged
in_looking
over_the
bows_for
the_approaching
anchor,_and
at_intervals
singing_what
seemed_a
dismal_stave
of_psalmody,
to_cheer
the_hands
at_the
windlass,_who
roared_forth
some_sort
of_a
chorus_about
the_girls
in_Booble
Alley,_with
hearty_good
will._
Nevertheless,_not
three_days
previous,_Bildad
had_told
them_that
no_profane
songs_would
be_allowed
on_board
the_Pequod,
particularly_in
getting_under
weigh;_and
Charity,_his
sister,_had
placed_a
small_choice
copy_of
Watts_in
each_seaman's
berth._
Meantime,_overseeing
the_other
part_of
the_ship,
Captain_Peleg
ripped_and
swore_astern
in_the
most_frightful
manner._
I_almost
thought_he
would_sink
the_ship
before_the
anchor_could
be_got
up;_involuntarily
I_paused
on_my
handspike,_and
told_Queequeg
to_do
the_same,
thinking_of
the_perils
we_both
ran,_in
starting_on
the_voyage
with_such
a_devil
for_a
pilot._
I_was
comforting_myself,
however,_with
the_thought
that_in
pious_Bildad
might_be
found_some
salvation,_spite
of_his
seven_hundred
and_seventy-seventh
lay;_when
I_felt
a_sudden
sharp_poke
in_my
rear,_and
turning_round,
was_horrified
at_the
apparition_of
Captain_Peleg
in_the
act_of
withdrawing_his
leg_from
my_immediate
vicinity._
That_was
my_first
kick._
"Is_that
the_way
they_heave
in_the
marchant_service?"
he_roared.
"Spring,_thou
sheep-head;_spring,
and_break
thy_backbone!
_Why
don't_ye
spring,_I
say,_all
of_ye--spring!
_Quohog!
spring,_thou
chap_with
the_red
whiskers;_spring
there,_Scotch-cap;
spring,_thou
green_pants.
_Spring,
I_say,
all_of
ye,_and
spring_your
eyes_out!"
_And
so_saying,
he_moved
along_the
windlass,_here
and_there
using_his
leg_very
freely,_while
imperturbable_Bildad
kept_leading
off_with
his_psalmody.
_Thinks
I,_Captain
Peleg_must
have_been
drinking_something
to-day._
At_last
the_anchor
was_up,
the_sails
were_set,
and_off
we_glided.
_It
was_a
short,_cold
Christmas;_and
as_the
short_northern
day_merged
into_night,
we_found
ourselves_almost
broad_upon
the_wintry
ocean,_whose
freezing_spray
cased_us
in_ice,
as_in
polished_armor.
_The
long_rows
of_teeth
on_the
bulwarks_glistened
in_the
moonlight;_and
like_the
white_ivory
tusks_of
some_huge
elephant,_vast
curving_icicles
depended_from
the_bows.
_Lank
Bildad,_as
pilot,_headed
the_first
watch,_and
ever_and
anon,_as
the_old
craft_deep
dived_into
the_green
seas,_and
sent_the
shivering_frost
all_over
her,_and
the_winds
howled,_and
the_cordage
rang,_his
steady_notes
were_heard,--
_"Sweet
fields_beyond
the_swelling
flood,_Stand
dressed_in
living_green.
So_to
the_Jews
old_Canaan
stood,_While
Jordan_rolled
between."_
_Never
did_those
sweet_words
sound_more
sweetly_to
me_than
then._
They_were
full_of
hope_and
fruition._
Spite_of
this_frigid
winter_night
in_the
boisterous_Atlantic,
spite_of
my_wet
feet_and
wetter_jacket,
there_was
yet,_it
then_seemed
to_me,
many_a
pleasant_haven
in_store;
and_meads
and_glades
so_eternally
vernal,_that
the_grass
shot_up
by_the
spring,_untrodden,
unwilted,_remains
at_midsummer.
_At
last_we
gained_such
an_offing,
that_the
two_pilots
were_needed
no_longer.
_The
stout_sail-boat
that_had
accompanied_us
began_ranging
alongside._
It_was
curious_and
not_unpleasing,
how_Peleg
and_Bildad
were_affected
at_this
juncture,_especially
Captain_Bildad.
_For
loath_to
depart,_yet;
very_loath
to_leave,
for_good,
a_ship
bound_on
so_long
and_perilous
a_voyage--beyond
both_stormy
Capes;_a
ship_in
which_some
thousands_of
his_hard
earned_dollars
were_invested;
a_ship,
in_which
an_old
shipmate_sailed
as_captain;
a_man
almost_as
old_as
he,_once
more_starting
to_encounter
all_the
terrors_of
the_pitiless
jaw;_loath
to_say
good-bye_to
a_thing
so_every
way_brimful
of_every
interest_to
him,--poor_old
Bildad_lingered
long;_paced
the_deck
with_anxious
strides;_ran
down_into
the_cabin
to_speak
another_farewell
word_there;
again_came
on_deck,
and_looked
to_windward;
looked_towards
the_wide
and_endless
waters,_only
bounded_by
the_far-off
unseen_Eastern
Continents;_looked
towards_the
land;_looked
aloft;_looked
right_and
left;_looked
everywhere_and
nowhere;_and
at_last,
mechanically_coiling
a_rope
upon_its
pin,_convulsively
grasped_stout
Peleg_by
the_hand,
and_holding
up_a
lantern,_for
a_moment
stood_gazing
heroically_in
his_face,
as_much
as_to
say,_"Nevertheless,
friend_Peleg,
I_can
stand_it;
yes,_I
can."_
As_for
Peleg_himself,
he_took
it_more
like_a
philosopher;_but
for_all
his_philosophy,
there_was
a_tear
twinkling_in
his_eye,
when_the
lantern_came
too_near.
_And
he,_too,
did_not
a_little
run_from
cabin_to
deck--now_a
word_below,
and_now
a_word
with_Starbuck,
the_chief
mate._
But,_at
last,_he
turned_to
his_comrade,
with_a
final_sort
of_look
about_him,--"Captain
Bildad--come,_old
shipmate,_we
must_go.
_Back
the_main-yard
there!_
Boat_ahoy!
_Stand
by_to
come_close
alongside,_now!
_Careful,
careful!--come,_Bildad,
boy--say_your
last._
Luck_to
ye,_Starbuck--luck
to_ye,
Mr._Stubb--luck
to_ye,
Mr._Flask--good-bye
and_good
luck_to
ye_all--and
this_day
three_years
I'll_have
a_hot
supper_smoking
for_ye
in_old
Nantucket._
Hurrah_and
away!"_
"God_bless
ye,_and
have_ye
in_His
holy_keeping,
men,"_murmured
old_Bildad,
almost_incoherently.
_"I
hope_ye'll
have_fine
weather_now,
so_that
Captain_Ahab
may_soon
be_moving
among_ye--a
pleasant_sun
is_all
he_needs,
and_ye'll
have_plenty
of_them
in_the
tropic_voyage
ye_go.
Be_careful
in_the
hunt,_ye
mates._
Don't_stave
the_boats
needlessly,_ye
harpooneers;_good
white_cedar
plank_is
raised_full
three_per
cent._within
the_year.
_Don't
forget_your
prayers,_either.
_Mr.
Starbuck,_mind
that_cooper
don't_waste
the_spare
staves._
Oh!_the
sail-needles_are
in_the
green_locker!
_Don't
whale_it
too_much
a'_Lord's
days,_men;
but_don't
miss_a
fair_chance
either,_that's
rejecting_Heaven's
good_gifts.
_Have
an_eye
to_the
molasses_tierce,
Mr._Stubb;
it_was
a_little
leaky,_I
thought._
If_ye
touch_at
the_islands,
Mr._Flask,
beware_of
fornication._
Good-bye,_good-bye!
_Don't
keep_that
cheese_too
long_down
in_the
hold,_Mr.
Starbuck;_it'll
spoil._
Be_careful
with_the
butter--twenty_cents
the_pound
it_was,
and_mind
ye,_if--"
_"Come,
come,_Captain
Bildad;_stop
palavering,--away!"_and
with_that,
Peleg_hurried
him_over
the_side,
and_both
dropt_into
the_boat.
_Ship
and_boat
diverged;_the
cold,_damp
night_breeze
blew_between;
a_screaming
gull_flew
overhead;_the
two_hulls
wildly_rolled;
we_gave
three_heavy-hearted
cheers,_and
blindly_plunged
like_fate
into_the
lone_Atlantic.
_
_CHAPTER
23_
The_Lee
Shore._
_Some
chapters_back,
one_Bulkington
was_spoken
of,_a
tall,_newlanded
mariner,_encountered
in_New
Bedford_at
the_inn.
_When
on_that
shivering_winter's
night,_the
Pequod_thrust
her_vindictive
bows_into
the_cold
malicious_waves,
who_should
I_see
standing_at
her_helm
but_Bulkington!
_I
looked_with
sympathetic_awe
and_fearfulness
upon_the
man,_who
in_mid-winter
just_landed
from_a
four_years'
dangerous_voyage,
could_so
unrestingly_push
off_again
for_still
another_tempestuous
term._
The_land
seemed_scorching
to_his
feet._
Wonderfullest_things
are_ever
the_unmentionable;
deep_memories
yield_no
epitaphs;_this
six-inch_chapter
is_the
stoneless_grave
of_Bulkington.
_Let
me_only
say_that
it_fared
with_him
as_with
the_storm-tossed
ship,_that
miserably_drives
along_the
leeward_land.
_The
port_would
fain_give
succor;_the
port_is
pitiful;_in
the_port
is_safety,
comfort,_hearthstone,
supper,_warm
blankets,_friends,
all_that's
kind_to
our_mortalities.
_But
in_that
gale,_the
port,_the
land,_is
that_ship's
direst_jeopardy;
she_must
fly_all
hospitality;_one
touch_of
land,_though
it_but
graze_the
keel,_would
make_her
shudder_through
and_through.
_With
all_her
might_she
crowds_all
sail_off
shore;_in
so_doing,
fights_'gainst
the_very
winds_that
fain_would
blow_her
homeward;_seeks
all_the
lashed_sea's
landlessness_again;
for_refuge's
sake_forlornly
rushing_into
peril;_her
only_friend
her_bitterest
foe!_
Know_ye
now,_Bulkington?
_Glimpses
do_ye
seem_to
see_of
that_mortally
intolerable_truth;
that_all
deep,_earnest
thinking_is
but_the
intrepid_effort
of_the
soul_to
keep_the
open_independence
of_her
sea;_while
the_wildest
winds_of
heaven_and
earth_conspire
to_cast
her_on
the_treacherous,
slavish_shore?
_But
as_in
landlessness_alone
resides_highest
truth,_shoreless,
indefinite_as
God--so,_better
is_it
to_perish
in_that
howling_infinite,
than_be
ingloriously_dashed
upon_the
lee,_even
if_that
were_safety!
_For
worm-like,_then,
oh!_who
would_craven
crawl_to
land!_Terrors
of_the
terrible!_is
all_this
agony_so
vain?_
Take_heart,
take_heart,
O_Bulkington!
_Bear
thee_grimly,
demigod!_
Up_from
the_spray
of_thy
ocean-perishing--straight_up,
leaps_thy
apotheosis!_
_
CHAPTER_24
_The
Advocate._
_As
Queequeg_and
I_are
now_fairly
embarked_in
this_business
of_whaling;
and_as
this_business
of_whaling
has_somehow
come_to
be_regarded
among_landsmen
as_a
rather_unpoetical
and_disreputable
pursuit;_therefore,
I_am
all_anxiety
to_convince
ye,_ye
landsmen,_of
the_injustice
hereby_done
to_us
hunters_of
whales._
In_the
first_place,
it_may
be_deemed
almost_superfluous
to_establish
the_fact,
that_among
people_at
large,_the
business_of
whaling_is
not_accounted
on_a
level_with
what_are
called_the
liberal_professions.
If_a
stranger_were
introduced_into
any_miscellaneous
metropolitan_society,
it_would
but_slightly
advance_the
general_opinion
of_his
merits,_were
he_presented
to_the
company_as
a_harpooneer,
say;_and
if_in
emulation_of
the_naval
officers_he
should_append
the_initials
S.W.F._(Sperm
Whale_Fishery)
to_his
visiting_card,
such_a
procedure_would
be_deemed
pre-eminently_presuming
and_ridiculous.
_Doubtless
one_leading
reason_why
the_world
declines_honouring
us_whalemen,
is_this:
they_think
that,_at
best,_our
vocation_amounts
to_a
butchering_sort
of_business;
and_that
when_actively
engaged_therein,
we_are
surrounded_by
all_manner
of_defilements.
_Butchers
we_are,
that_is
true._
But_butchers,
also,_and
butchers_of
the_bloodiest
badge_have
been_all
Martial_Commanders
whom_the
world_invariably
delights_to
honour._
And_as
for_the
matter_of
the_alleged
uncleanliness_of
our_business,
ye_shall
soon_be
initiated_into
certain_facts
hitherto_pretty
generally_unknown,
and_which,
upon_the
whole,_will
triumphantly_plant
the_sperm
whale-ship_at
least_among
the_cleanliest
things_of
this_tidy
earth._
But_even
granting_the
charge_in
question_to
be_true;
what_disordered
slippery_decks
of_a
whale-ship_are
comparable_to
the_unspeakable
carrion_of
those_battle-fields
from_which
so_many
soldiers_return
to_drink
in_all
ladies'_plaudits?
_And
if_the
idea_of
peril_so
much_enhances
the_popular
conceit_of
the_soldier's
profession;_let
me_assure
ye_that
many_a
veteran_who
has_freely
marched_up
to_a
battery,_would
quickly_recoil
at_the
apparition_of
the_sperm
whale's_vast
tail,_fanning
into_eddies
the_air
over_his
head._
For_what
are_the
comprehensible_terrors
of_man
compared_with
the_interlinked
terrors_and
wonders_of
God!_
But,_though
the_world
scouts_at
us_whale
hunters,_yet
does_it
unwittingly_pay
us_the
profoundest_homage;
yea,_an
all-abounding_adoration!
for_almost
all_the
tapers,_lamps,
and_candles
that_burn
round_the
globe,_burn,
as_before
so_many
shrines,_to
our_glory!
_But
look_at
this_matter
in_other
lights;_weigh
it_in
all_sorts
of_scales;
see_what
we_whalemen
are,_and
have_been.
_Why
did_the
Dutch_in
De_Witt's
time_have
admirals_of
their_whaling
fleets?_
Why_did
Louis_XVI.
of_France,
at_his
own_personal
expense,_fit
out_whaling
ships_from
Dunkirk,_and
politely_invite
to_that
town_some
score_or
two_of
families_from
our_own
island_of
Nantucket?_
Why_did
Britain_between
the_years
1750_and
1788_pay
to_her
whalemen_in
bounties_upwards
of_L1,000,000?
_And
lastly,_how
comes_it
that_we
whalemen_of
America_now
outnumber_all
the_rest
of_the
banded_whalemen
in_the
world;_sail
a_navy
of_upwards
of_seven
hundred_vessels;
manned_by
eighteen_thousand
men;_yearly
consuming_4,000,000
of_dollars;
the_ships
worth,_at
the_time
of_sailing,
$20,000,000!_and
every_year
importing_into
our_harbors
a_well
reaped_harvest
of_$7,000,000.
_How
comes_all
this,_if
there_be
not_something
puissant_in
whaling?_
But_this
is_not
the_half;
look_again.
_I
freely_assert,
that_the
cosmopolite_philosopher
cannot,_for
his_life,
point_out
one_single
peaceful_influence,
which_within
the_last
sixty_years
has_operated
more_potentially
upon_the
whole_broad
world,_taken
in_one
aggregate,_than
the_high
and_mighty
business_of
whaling._One
way_and
another,_it
has_begotten
events_so
remarkable_in
themselves,_and
so_continuously
momentous_in
their_sequential
issues,_that
whaling_may
well_be
regarded_as
that_Egyptian
mother,_who
bore_offspring
themselves_pregnant
from_her
womb._
It_would
be_a
hopeless,_endless
task_to
catalogue_all
these_things.
_Let
a_handful
suffice._For
many_years
past_the
whale-ship_has
been_the
pioneer_in
ferreting_out
the_remotest
and_least
known_parts
of_the
earth._
She_has
explored_seas
and_archipelagoes
which_had
no_chart,
where_no
Cook_or
Vancouver_had
ever_sailed.
_If
American_and
European_men-of-war
now_peacefully
ride_in
once_savage
harbors,_let
them_fire
salutes_to
the_honour
and_glory
of_the
whale-ship,_which
originally_showed
them_the
way,_and
first_interpreted
between_them
and_the
savages._
They_may
celebrate_as
they_will
the_heroes
of_Exploring
Expeditions,_your
Cooks,_your
Krusensterns;_but
I_say
that_scores
of_anonymous
Captains_have
sailed_out
of_Nantucket,
that_were
as_great,
and_greater
than_your
Cook_and
your_Krusenstern.
_For
in_their
succourless_empty-handedness,
they,_in
the_heathenish
sharked_waters,
and_by
the_beaches
of_unrecorded,
javelin_islands,
battled_with
virgin_wonders
and_terrors
that_Cook
with_all
his_marines
and_muskets
would_not
willingly_have
dared._
All_that
is_made
such_a
flourish_of
in_the
old_South
Sea_Voyages,
those_things
were_but
the_life-time
commonplaces_of
our_heroic
Nantucketers._
Often,_adventures
which_Vancouver
dedicates_three
chapters_to,
these_men
accounted_unworthy
of_being
set_down
in_the
ship's_common
log._
Ah,_the
world!_
Oh,_the
world!_
Until_the
whale_fishery
rounded_Cape
Horn,_no
commerce_but
colonial,_scarcely
any_intercourse
but_colonial,
was_carried
on_between
Europe_and
the_long
line_of
the_opulent
Spanish_provinces
on_the
Pacific_coast.
_It
was_the
whaleman_who
first_broke
through_the
jealous_policy
of_the
Spanish_crown,
touching_those
colonies;_and,
if_space
permitted,_it
might_be
distinctly_shown
how_from
those_whalemen
at_last
eventuated_the
liberation_of
Peru,_Chili,
and_Bolivia
from_the
yoke_of
Old_Spain,
and_the
establishment_of
the_eternal
democracy_in
those_parts.
_That
great_America
on_the
other_side
of_the
sphere,_Australia,
was_given
to_the
enlightened_world
by_the
whaleman._
After_its
first_blunder-born
discovery_by
a_Dutchman,
all_other
ships_long
shunned_those
shores_as
pestiferously_barbarous;
but_the
whale-ship_touched
there._
The_whale-ship
is_the
true_mother
of_that
now_mighty
colony._Moreover,
in_the
infancy_of
the_first
Australian_settlement,
the_emigrants
were_several
times_saved
from_starvation
by_the
benevolent_biscuit
of_the
whale-ship_luckily
dropping_an
anchor_in
their_waters.
The_uncounted
isles_of
all_Polynesia
confess_the
same_truth,
and_do
commercial_homage
to_the
whale-ship,_that
cleared_the
way_for
the_missionary
and_the
merchant,_and
in_many
cases_carried
the_primitive
missionaries_to
their_first
destinations._
If_that
double-bolted_land,
Japan,_is
ever_to
become_hospitable,
it_is
the_whale-ship
alone_to
whom_the
credit_will
be_due;
for_already
she_is
on_the
threshold._
But_if,
in_the
face_of
all_this,
you_still
declare_that
whaling_has
no_aesthetically
noble_associations
connected_with
it,_then
am_I
ready_to
shiver_fifty
lances_with
you_there,
and_unhorse
you_with
a_split
helmet_every
time._
The_whale
has_no
famous_author,
and_whaling
no_famous
chronicler,_you
will_say.
_THE
WHALE_NO
FAMOUS_AUTHOR,
AND_WHALING
NO_FAMOUS
CHRONICLER?_
Who_wrote
the_first
account_of
our_Leviathan?
_Who
but_mighty
Job!_
And_who
composed_the
first_narrative
of_a
whaling-voyage?_
Who,_but
no_less
a_prince
than_Alfred
the_Great,
who,_with
his_own
royal_pen,
took_down
the_words
from_Other,
the_Norwegian
whale-hunter_of
those_times!
_And
who_pronounced
our_glowing
eulogy_in
Parliament?_
Who,_but
Edmund_Burke!
_True
enough,_but
then_whalemen
themselves_are
poor_devils;
they_have
no_good
blood_in
their_veins.
_NO
GOOD_BLOOD
IN_THEIR
VEINS?_
They_have
something_better
than_royal
blood_there.
_The
grandmother_of
Benjamin_Franklin
was_Mary
Morrel;_afterwards,
by_marriage,
Mary_Folger,
one_of
the_old
settlers_of
Nantucket,_and
the_ancestress

and_harpooneers--all
kith_and
kin_to
noble_Benjamin--this
day_darting
the_barbed
iron_from
one_side
of_the
world_to
the_other.
_Good
again;_but
then_all
confess_that
somehow_whaling
is_not
respectable._
WHALING_NOT
RESPECTABLE?_
Whaling_is
imperial!_
By_old
English_statutory
law,_the
whale_is
declared_"a
royal_fish."*
_Oh,
that's_only
nominal!_
The_whale
himself_has
never_figured
in_any
grand_imposing
way._

most_conspicuous
object_in

_
Grant_it,
since_you
cite_it;
but,_say
what_you
will,_there
is_no

in_whaling.
_NO

_
CHAPTER_25
_Postscript.
_
In_behalf
of_the
dignity_of
whaling,_I
would_fain
advance_naught
but_substantiated
facts._
But_after
embattling_his
facts,_an
advocate_who
should_wholly
suppress_a
not_unreasonable
surmise,_which
might_tell
eloquently_upon
his_cause--such
an_advocate,
would_he
not_be
blameworthy?_
It_is
well_known
that_at
the_coronation
of_kings
and_queens,
even_modern
ones,_a
certain_curious
process_of
seasoning_them
for_their
functions_is
gone_through.
_There
is_a
saltcellar_of
state,_so
called,_and
there_may
be_a
castor_of
state._
How_they
use_the
salt,_precisely--who
knows?_
Certain_I
am,_however,
that_a
king's_head
is_solemnly
oiled_at
his_coronation,
even_as
a_head
of_salad.
_Can
it_be,
though,_that
they_anoint
it_with
a_view
of_making
its_interior
run_well,
as_they
anoint_machinery?
_Much
might_be
ruminated_here,
concerning_the
essential_dignity
of_this
regal_process,
because_in
common_life
we_esteem
but_meanly
and_contemptibly
a_fellow
who_anoints
his_hair,
and_palpably
smells_of
that_anointing.
_In
truth,_a
mature_man
who_uses
hair-oil,_unless
medicinally,_that
man_has
probably_got
a_quoggy
spot_in
him_somewhere.
_As
a_general
rule,_he
can't_amount
to_much
in_his
totality._
But_the
only_thing
to_be
considered_here,
is_this--what
kind_of
oil_is
used_at
coronations?_
Certainly_it
cannot_be
olive_oil,
nor_macassar
oil,_nor
castor_oil,
nor_bear's
oil,_nor
train_oil,
nor_cod-liver
oil._
What_then
can_it
possibly_be,
but_sperm
oil_in
its_unmanufactured,
unpolluted_state,
the_sweetest
of_all
oils?_
Think_of
that,_ye
loyal_Britons!
we_whalemen
supply_your
kings_and
queens_with
coronation_stuff!
_
_CHAPTER
26_
Knights_and
Squires._
_The
chief_mate
of_the
Pequod_was
Starbuck,_a
native_of
Nantucket,_and
a_Quaker
by_descent.
_He
was_a
long,_earnest
man,_and
though_born
on_an
icy_coast,
seemed_well
adapted_to
endure_hot
latitudes,_his
flesh_being
hard_as
twice-baked_biscuit.
_Transported
to_the
Indies,_his
live_blood
would_not
spoil_like
bottled_ale.
_He
must_have
been_born
in_some
time_of
general_drought
and_famine,
or_upon
one_of
those_fast
days_for
which_his
state_is
famous._
Only_some
thirty_arid
summers_had
he_seen;
those_summers
had_dried
up_all
his_physical
superfluousness._
But_this,
his_thinness,
so_to
speak,_seemed
no_more
the_token
of_wasting
anxieties_and
cares,_than
it_seemed
the_indication
of_any
bodily_blight.
_It
was_merely
the_condensation
of_the
man._
He_was
by_no
means_ill-looking;
quite_the
contrary._
His_pure
tight_skin
was_an
excellent_fit;
and_closely
wrapped_up
in_it,
and_embalmed
with_inner
health_and
strength,_like
a_revivified
Egyptian,_this
Starbuck_seemed
prepared_to
endure_for
long_ages
to_come,
and_to
endure_always,
as_now;
for_be
it_Polar
snow_or
torrid_sun,
like_a
patent_chronometer,
his_interior
vitality_was
warranted_to
do_well
in_all
climates._
Looking_into
his_eyes,
you_seemed
to_see
there_the
yet_lingering
images_of
those_thousand-fold
perils_he
had_calmly
confronted_through
life._
A_staid,
steadfast_man,
whose_life
for_the
most_part
was_a
telling_pantomime
of_action,
and_not
a_tame
chapter_of
sounds._
Yet,_for
all_his
hardy_sobriety
and_fortitude,
there_were
certain_qualities
in_him
which_at
times_affected,
and_in
some_cases
seemed_well
nigh_to
overbalance_all
the_rest.
_Uncommonly
conscientious_for
a_seaman,
and_endued
with_a
deep_natural
reverence,_the
wild_watery
loneliness_of
his_life
did_therefore
strongly_incline
him_to
superstition;_but
to_that
sort_of
superstition,_which
in_some
organizations_seems
rather_to
spring,_somehow,
from_intelligence
than_from
ignorance._
Outward_portents
and_inward
presentiments_were
his._
And_if
at_times
these_things
bent_the
welded_iron
of_his
soul,_much
more_did
his_far-away
domestic_memories
of_his
young_Cape
wife_and
child,_tend
to_bend
him_still
more_from
the_original
ruggedness_of
his_nature,
and_open
him_still
further_to
those_latent
influences_which,
in_some
honest-hearted_men,
restrain_the
gush_of
dare-devil_daring,
so_often
evinced_by
others_in
the_more
perilous_vicissitudes
of_the
fishery._
"I_will
have_no
man_in
my_boat,"
said_Starbuck,
"who_is
not_afraid
of_a
whale."_
By_this,
he_seemed
to_mean,
not_only
that_the
most_reliable
and_useful
courage_was
that_which
arises_from
the_fair
estimation_of
the_encountered
peril,_but
that_an
utterly_fearless
man_is
a_far
more_dangerous
comrade_than
a_coward.
_"Aye,
aye,"_said
Stubb,_the
second_mate,
"Starbuck,_there,
is_as
careful_a
man_as
you'll_find
anywhere_in
this_fishery."
_But
we_shall
ere_long
see_what
that_word
"careful"_precisely
means_when
used_by
a_man
like_Stubb,
or_almost
any_other
whale_hunter.
_Starbuck
was_no
crusader_after
perils;_in
him_courage
was_not
a_sentiment;
but_a
thing_simply
useful_to
him,_and
always_at
hand_upon
all_mortally
practical_occasions.
_Besides,
he_thought,
perhaps,_that
in_this
business_of
whaling,_courage
was_one
of_the
great_staple
outfits_of
the_ship,
like_her
beef_and
her_bread,
and_not
to_be
foolishly_wasted.
_Wherefore
he_had
no_fancy
for_lowering
for_whales
after_sun-down;
nor_for
persisting_in
fighting_a
fish_that
too_much
persisted_in
fighting_him.
_For,
thought_Starbuck,
I_am
here_in
this_critical
ocean_to
kill_whales
for_my
living,_and
not_to
be_killed
by_them
for_theirs;
and_that
hundreds_of
men_had
been_so
killed_Starbuck
well_knew.
_What
doom_was
his_own
father's?_
Where,_in
the_bottomless
deeps,_could
he_find
the_torn
limbs_of
his_brother?
_With
memories_like
these_in
him,_and,
moreover,_given
to_a
certain_superstitiousness,
as_has
been_said;
the_courage
of_this
Starbuck_which
could,_nevertheless,
still_flourish,
must_indeed
have_been
extreme._
But_it
was_not
in_reasonable
nature_that
a_man
so_organized,
and_with
such_terrible
experiences_and
remembrances_as
he_had;
it_was
not_in
nature_that
these_things
should_fail
in_latently
engendering_an
element_in
him,_which,
under_suitable
circumstances,_would
break_out
from_its
confinement,_and
burn_all
his_courage
up._And
brave_as
he_might
be,_it
was_that
sort_of
bravery_chiefly,
visible_in
some_intrepid
men,_which,
while_generally
abiding_firm
in_the
conflict_with
seas,_or
winds,_or
whales,_or
any_of
the_ordinary
irrational_horrors
of_the
world,_yet
cannot_withstand
those_more
terrific,_because
more_spiritual
terrors,_which
sometimes_menace
you_from
the_concentrating
brow_of
an_enraged
and_mighty
man._
But_were
the_coming
narrative_to
reveal_in
any_instance,
the_complete
abasement_of
poor_Starbuck's
fortitude,_scarce
might_I
have_the
heart_to
write_it;
for_it
is_a
thing_most
sorrowful,_nay
shocking,_to
expose_the
fall_of
valour_in
the_soul.
_Men
may_seem
detestable_as
joint_stock-companies
and_nations;
knaves,_fools,
and_murderers
there_may
be;_men
may_have
mean_and
meagre_faces;
but_man,
in_the
ideal,_is
so_noble
and_so
sparkling,_such
a_grand
and_glowing
creature,_that
over_any
ignominious_blemish
in_him
all_his
fellows_should
run_to
throw_their
costliest_robes.
_That
immaculate_manliness
we_feel
within_ourselves,
so_far
within_us,
that_it
remains_intact
though_all
the_outer
character_seem
gone;_bleeds
with_keenest
anguish_at
the_undraped
spectacle_of
a_valor-ruined
man._
Nor_can
piety_itself,
at_such
a_shameful
sight,_completely
stifle_her
upbraidings_against
the_permitting
stars._
But_this
august_dignity
I_treat
of,_is
not_the
dignity_of
kings_and
robes,_but
that_abounding
dignity_which

_CHAPTER
27_
Knights_and
Squires._
_Stubb
was_the
second_mate.
_He
was_a
native_of
Cape_Cod;
and_hence,
according_to
local_usage,
was_called
a_Cape-Cod-man.
_A
happy-go-lucky;_neither
craven_nor
valiant;_taking
perils_as
they_came
with_an
indifferent_air;
and_while
engaged_in
the_most
imminent_crisis
of_the
chase,_toiling
away,_calm
and_collected
as_a
journeyman_joiner
engaged_for
the_year.
_Good-humored,
easy,_and
careless,_he
presided_over
his_whale-boat
as_if
the_most
deadly_encounter
were_but
a_dinner,
and_his
crew_all
invited_guests.
_He
was_as
particular_about
the_comfortable
arrangement_of
his_part
of_the
boat,_as
an_old
stage-driver_is
about_the
snugness_of
his_box.
_When
close_to
the_whale,
in_the
very_death-lock
of_the
fight,_he
handled_his
unpitying_lance
coolly_and
off-handedly,_as
a_whistling
tinker_his
hammer._
He_would
hum_over
his_old
rigadig_tunes
while_flank
and_flank
with_the
most_exasperated
monster._
Long_usage
had,_for
this_Stubb,
converted_the
jaws_of
death_into
an_easy
chair._
What_he
thought_of
death_itself,
there_is
no_telling.
_Whether
he_ever
thought_of
it_at
all,_might
be_a
question;_but,
if_he
ever_did
chance_to
cast_his
mind_that
way_after
a_comfortable
dinner,_no
doubt,_like
a_good
sailor,_he
took_it
to_be
a_sort
of_call
of_the
watch_to
tumble_aloft,
and_bestir
themselves_there,
about_something
which_he
would_find
out_when
he_obeyed
the_order,
and_not
sooner._
What,_perhaps,
with_other
things,_made
Stubb_such
an_easy-going,
unfearing_man,
so_cheerily
trudging_off
with_the
burden_of
life_in
a_world
full_of
grave_pedlars,
all_bowed
to_the
ground_with
their_packs;
what_helped
to_bring
about_that
almost_impious
good-humor_of
his;_that
thing_must
have_been
his_pipe.
_For,
like_his
nose,_his
short,_black
little_pipe
was_one
of_the
regular_features
of_his
face._You
would_almost
as_soon
have_expected
him_to
turn_out
of_his
bunk_without
his_nose
as_without
his_pipe.
_He
kept_a
whole_row
of_pipes
there_ready
loaded,_stuck
in_a
rack,_within
easy_reach
of_his
hand;_and,
whenever_he
turned_in,
he_smoked
them_all
out_in
succession,_lighting
one_from
the_other
to_the
end_of
the_chapter;
then_loading
them_again
to_be
in_readiness
anew._
For,_when
Stubb_dressed,
instead_of
first_putting
his_legs
into_his
trowsers,_he
put_his
pipe_into
his_mouth.
_I
say_this
continual_smoking
must_have
been_one
cause,_at
least,_of
his_peculiar
disposition;_for
every_one
knows_that
this_earthly
air,_whether
ashore_or
afloat,_is
terribly_infected
with_the
nameless_miseries
of_the
numberless_mortals
who_have
died_exhaling
it;_and
as_in
time_of
the_cholera,
some_people
go_about
with_a
camphorated_handkerchief
to_their
mouths;_so,
likewise,_against
all_mortal
tribulations,_Stubb's
tobacco_smoke
might_have
operated_as
a_sort
of_disinfecting
agent._
The_third
mate_was
Flask,_a
native_of
Tisbury,_in
Martha's_Vineyard.
A_short,
stout,_ruddy
young_fellow,
very_pugnacious
concerning_whales,
who_somehow
seemed_to
think_that
the_great
leviathans_had
personally_and
hereditarily_affronted
him;_and
therefore_it
was_a
sort_of
point_of
honour_with
him,_to
destroy_them
whenever_encountered.
_So
utterly_lost
was_he
to_all
sense_of
reverence_for
the_many
marvels_of
their_majestic
bulk_and
mystic_ways;
and_so
dead_to
anything_like
an_apprehension
of_any
possible_danger
from_encountering
them;_that
in_his
poor_opinion,
the_wondrous
whale_was
but_a
species_of
magnified_mouse,
or_at
least_water-rat,
requiring_only
a_little
circumvention_and
some_small
application_of
time_and
trouble_in
order_to
kill_and
boil._
This_ignorant,
unconscious_fearlessness
of_his
made_him
a_little
waggish_in
the_matter
of_whales;
he_followed
these_fish
for_the
fun_of
it;_and
a_three
years'_voyage
round_Cape
Horn_was
only_a
jolly_joke
that_lasted
that_length
of_time.
_As
a_carpenter's
nails_are
divided_into
wrought_nails
and_cut
nails;_so
mankind_may
be_similarly
divided._
Little_Flask
was_one
of_the
wrought_ones;
made_to
clinch_tight
and_last
long._
They_called
him_King-Post
on_board
of_the
Pequod;_because,
in_form,
he_could
be_well
likened_to
the_short,
square_timber
known_by
that_name
in_Arctic
whalers;_and
which_by
the_means
of_many
radiating_side
timbers_inserted
into_it,
serves_to
brace_the
ship_against
the_icy
concussions_of
those_battering
seas._
Now_these
three_mates--Starbuck,
Stubb,_and
Flask,_were
momentous_men.
_They
it_was
who_by
universal_prescription
commanded_three
of_the
Pequod's_boats
as_headsmen.
_In
that_grand
order_of
battle_in
which_Captain
Ahab_would
probably_marshal
his_forces
to_descend
on_the
whales,_these
three_headsmen
were_as
captains_of
companies._
Or,_being
armed_with
their_long
keen_whaling
spears,_they
were_as
a_picked
trio_of
lancers;_even
as_the
harpooneers_were
flingers_of
javelins._
And_since
in_this
famous_fishery,
each_mate
or_headsman,
like_a
Gothic_Knight
of_old,
is_always
accompanied_by
his_boat-steerer
or_harpooneer,
who_in
certain_conjunctures
provides_him
with_a
fresh_lance,
when_the
former_one
has_been
badly_twisted,
or_elbowed
in_the
assault;_and
moreover,_as
there_generally
subsists_between
the_two,
a_close
intimacy_and
friendliness;_it
is_therefore
but_meet,
that_in
this_place
we_set
down_who
the_Pequod's
harpooneers_were,
and_to
what_headsman
each_of
them_belonged.
_First
of_all
was_Queequeg,
whom_Starbuck,
the_chief
mate,_had
selected_for
his_squire.
_But
Queequeg_is
already_known.
_Next
was_Tashtego,
an_unmixed
Indian_from
Gay_Head,
the_most
westerly_promontory
of_Martha's
Vineyard,_where
there_still
exists_the
last_remnant
of_a
village_of
red_men,
which_has
long_supplied
the_neighboring
island_of
Nantucket_with
many_of
her_most
daring_harpooneers.
_In
the_fishery,
they_usually
go_by
the_generic
name_of
Gay-Headers._
Tashtego's_long,
lean,_sable
hair,_his
high_cheek
bones,_and
black_rounding
eyes--for_an
Indian,_Oriental
in_their
largeness,_but
Antarctic_in
their_glittering
expression--all_this
sufficiently_proclaimed
him_an
inheritor_of
the_unvitiated
blood_of
those_proud
warrior_hunters,
who,_in
quest_of
the_great
New_England
moose,_had
scoured,_bow
in_hand,
the_aboriginal
forests_of
the_main.
But_no
longer_snuffing
in_the
trail_of
the_wild
beasts_of
the_woodland,
Tashtego_now
hunted_in
the_wake
of_the
great_whales
of_the
sea;_the
unerring_harpoon
of_the
son_fitly
replacing_the
infallible_arrow
of_the
sires._
To_look
at_the
tawny_brawn
of_his
lithe_snaky
limbs,_you
would_almost
have_credited
the_superstitions
of_some
of_the
earlier_Puritans,
and_half-believed
this_wild
Indian_to
be_a
son_of
the_Prince
of_the
Powers_of
the_Air.
_Tashtego
was_Stubb
the_second
mate's_squire.
_Third
among_the
harpooneers_was
Daggoo,_a
gigantic,_coal-black
negro-savage,_with
a_lion-like
tread--an_Ahasuerus
to_behold.
Suspended_from
his_ears
were_two
golden_hoops,
so_large
that_the
sailors_called
them_ring-bolts,
and_would
talk_of
securing_the
top-sail_halyards
to_them.
_In
his_youth
Daggoo_had
voluntarily_shipped
on_board
of_a
whaler,_lying
in_a
lonely_bay
on_his
native_coast.
_And
never_having
been_anywhere
in_the
world_but
in_Africa,
Nantucket,_and
the_pagan
harbors_most
frequented_by
whalemen;_and
having_now
led_for
many_years
the_bold
life_of
the_fishery
in_the
ships_of
owners_uncommonly
heedful_of
what_manner
of_men
they_shipped;
Daggoo_retained
all_his
barbaric_virtues,
and_erect
as_a
giraffe,_moved
about_the
decks_in
all_the
pomp_of
six_feet
five_in
his_socks.
_There
was_a
corporeal_humility
in_looking
up_at
him;_and
a_white
man_standing
before_him
seemed_a
white_flag
come_to
beg_truce
of_a
fortress._
Curious_to
tell,_this
imperial_negro,
Ahasuerus_Daggoo,
was_the
Squire_of
little_Flask,
who_looked
like_a
chess-man_beside
him._
As_for
the_residue
of_the
Pequod's_company,
be_it
said,_that
at_the
present_day
not_one
in_two
of_the
many_thousand
men_before
the_mast
employed_in
the_American
whale_fishery,
are_Americans
born,_though
pretty_nearly
all_the
officers_are.
_Herein
it_is
the_same
with_the
American_whale
fishery_as
with_the
American_army
and_military
and_merchant
navies,_and
the_engineering
forces_employed
in_the
construction_of
the_American
Canals_and
Railroads._
The_same,
I_say,
because_in
all_these
cases_the
native_American
liberally_provides
the_brains,
the_rest
of_the
world_as
generously_supplying
the_muscles.
_No
small_number
of_these
whaling_seamen
belong_to
the_Azores,
where_the
outward_bound
Nantucket_whalers
frequently_touch
to_augment
their_crews
from_the
hardy_peasants
of_those
rocky_shores.
In_like
manner,_the
Greenland_whalers
sailing_out
of_Hull
or_London,
put_in
at_the
Shetland_Islands,
to_receive
the_full
complement_of
their_crew.
_Upon
the_passage
homewards,_they
drop_them
there_again.
How_it
is,_there
is_no
telling,_but
Islanders_seem
to_make
the_best
whalemen._
They_were
nearly_all
Islanders_in
the_Pequod,
ISOLATOES_too,
I_call
such,_not
acknowledging_the
common_continent
of_men,
but_each
ISOLATO_living
on_a
separate_continent
of_his
own._
Yet_now,
federated_along
one_keel,
what_a
set_these
Isolatoes_were!
_An
Anacharsis_Clootz
deputation_from
all_the
isles_of
the_sea,
and_all
the_ends
of_the
earth,_accompanying
Old_Ahab
in_the
Pequod_to
lay_the
world's_grievances
before_that
bar_from
which_not
very_many
of_them
ever_come
back._
Black_Little
Pip--he_never
did--oh,_no!
he_went
before._
Poor_Alabama
boy!_
On_the
grim_Pequod's
forecastle,_ye
shall_ere
long_see
him,_beating
his_tambourine;
prelusive_of
the_eternal
time,_when
sent_for,
to_the
great_quarter-deck
on_high,
he_was
bid_strike
in_with
angels,_and
beat_his
tambourine_in
glory;_called
a_coward
here,_hailed
a_hero
there!_
_
CHAPTER_28
_Ahab.
_
For_several
days_after
leaving_Nantucket,
nothing_above
hatches_was
seen_of
Captain_Ahab.
_The
mates_regularly
relieved_each
other_at
the_watches,
and_for
aught_that
could_be
seen_to
the_contrary,
they_seemed
to_be
the_only
commanders_of
the_ship;
only_they
sometimes_issued
from_the
cabin_with
orders_so
sudden_and
peremptory,_that
after_all
it_was
plain_they
but_commanded
vicariously._
Yes,_their
supreme_lord
and_dictator
was_there,
though_hitherto
unseen_by
any_eyes
not_permitted
to_penetrate
into_the
now_sacred
retreat_of
the_cabin.
_Every
time_I
ascended_to
the_deck
from_my
watches_below,
I_instantly
gazed_aft
to_mark
if_any
strange_face
were_visible;
for_my
first_vague
disquietude_touching
the_unknown
captain,_now
in_the
seclusion_of
the_sea,
became_almost
a_perturbation.
_This
was_strangely
heightened_at
times_by
the_ragged
Elijah's_diabolical
incoherences_uninvitedly
recurring_to
me,_with
a_subtle
energy_I
could_not
have_before
conceived_of.
_But
poorly_could
I_withstand
them,_much
as_in
other_moods
I_was
almost_ready
to_smile
at_the
solemn_whimsicalities
of_that
outlandish_prophet
of_the
wharves._
But_whatever
it_was
of_apprehensiveness
or_uneasiness--to
call_it
so--which_I
felt,_yet
whenever_I
came_to
look_about
me_in
the_ship,
it_seemed
against_all
warrantry_to
cherish_such
emotions._
For_though
the_harpooneers,
with_the
great_body
of_the
crew,_were
a_far
more_barbaric,
heathenish,_and
motley_set
than_any
of_the
tame_merchant-ship
companies_which
my_previous
experiences_had
made_me
acquainted_with,
still_I
ascribed_this--and
rightly_ascribed
it--to_the
fierce_uniqueness
of_the
very_nature
of_that
wild_Scandinavian
vocation_in
which_I
had_so
abandonedly_embarked.
_But
it_was
especially_the
aspect_of
the_three
chief_officers
of_the
ship,_the
mates,_which
was_most
forcibly_calculated
to_allay
these_colourless
misgivings,_and
induce_confidence
and_cheerfulness
in_every
presentment_of
the_voyage.
_Three
better,_more
likely_sea-officers
and_men,
each_in
his_own
different_way,
could_not
readily_be
found,_and
they_were
every_one
of_them
Americans;_a
Nantucketer,_a
Vineyarder,_a
Cape_man.
_Now,
it_being
Christmas_when
the_ship
shot_from
out_her
harbor,_for
a_space
we_had
biting_Polar
weather,_though
all_the
time_running
away_from
it_to
the_southward;
and_by
every_degree
and_minute
of_latitude
which_we
sailed,_gradually
leaving_that
merciless_winter,
and_all
its_intolerable
weather_behind
us._
It_was
one_of
those_less
lowering,_but
still_grey
and_gloomy
enough_mornings
of_the
transition,_when
with_a
fair_wind
the_ship
was_rushing
through_the
water_with
a_vindictive
sort_of
leaping_and
melancholy_rapidity,
that_as
I_mounted
to_the
deck_at
the_call
of_the
forenoon_watch,
so_soon
as_I
levelled_my
glance_towards
the_taffrail,
foreboding_shivers
ran_over
me._Reality
outran_apprehension;
Captain_Ahab
stood_upon
his_quarter-deck.
_There
seemed_no
sign_of
common_bodily
illness_about
him,_nor
of_the
recovery_from
any._
He_looked
like_a
man_cut
away_from
the_stake,
when_the
fire_has
overrunningly_wasted
all_the
limbs_without
consuming_them,
or_taking
away_one
particle_from
their_compacted
aged_robustness.
_His
whole_high,
broad_form,
seemed_made
of_solid
bronze,_and
shaped_in
an_unalterable
mould,_like
Cellini's_cast
Perseus._Threading
its_way
out_from
among_his
grey_hairs,
and_continuing
right_down
one_side
of_his
tawny_scorched
face_and
neck,_till
it_disappeared
in_his
clothing,_you
saw_a
slender_rod-like
mark,_lividly
whitish._
It_resembled
that_perpendicular
seam_sometimes
made_in
the_straight,
lofty_trunk
of_a
great_tree,
when_the
upper_lightning
tearingly_darts
down_it,
and_without
wrenching_a
single_twig,
peels_and
grooves_out
the_bark
from_top
to_bottom,
ere_running
off_into
the_soil,
leaving_the
tree_still
greenly_alive,
but_branded.
_Whether
that_mark
was_born
with_him,
or_whether
it_was
the_scar
left_by
some_desperate
wound,_no
one_could
certainly_say.
_By
some_tacit
consent,_throughout
the_voyage
little_or
no_allusion
was_made
to_it,
especially_by
the_mates.
_But
once_Tashtego's
senior,_an
old_Gay-Head
Indian_among
the_crew,
superstitiously_asserted
that_not
till_he
was_full
forty_years
old_did
Ahab_become
that_way
branded,_and
then_it
came_upon
him,_not
in_the
fury_of
any_mortal
fray,_but
in_an
elemental_strife
at_sea.
_Yet,
this_wild
hint_seemed
inferentially_negatived,
by_what
a_grey
Manxman_insinuated,
an_old
sepulchral_man,
who,_having
never_before
sailed_out
of_Nantucket,
had_never
ere_this
laid_eye
upon_wild
Ahab._
Nevertheless,_the
old_sea-traditions,
the_immemorial
credulities,_popularly
invested_this
old_Manxman
with_preternatural
powers_of
discernment._
So_that
no_white
sailor_seriously
contradicted_him
when_he
said_that
if_ever
Captain_Ahab
should_be
tranquilly_laid
out--which_might
hardly_come
to_pass,
so_he
muttered--then,_whoever
should_do
that_last
office_for
the_dead,
would_find
a_birth-mark
on_him
from_crown
to_sole.
_So
powerfully_did
the_whole
grim_aspect
of_Ahab
affect_me,
and_the
livid_brand
which_streaked
it,_that
for_the
first_few
moments_I
hardly_noted
that_not
a_little
of_this
overbearing_grimness
was_owing
to_the
barbaric_white
leg_upon
which_he
partly_stood.
_It
had_previously
come_to
me_that
this_ivory
leg_had
at_sea
been_fashioned
from_the
polished_bone
of_the
sperm_whale's
jaw._
"Aye,_he
was_dismasted
off_Japan,"
said_the
old_Gay-Head
Indian_once;
"but_like
his_dismasted
craft,_he
shipped_another
mast_without
coming_home
for_it.
_He
has_a
quiver_of
'em."_
I_was
struck_with
the_singular
posture_he
maintained._
Upon_each
side_of
the_Pequod's
quarter_deck,
and_pretty
close_to
the_mizzen
shrouds,_there
was_an
auger_hole,
bored_about
half_an
inch_or
so,_into
the_plank.
_His
bone_leg
steadied_in
that_hole;
one_arm
elevated,_and
holding_by
a_shroud;
Captain_Ahab
stood_erect,
looking_straight
out_beyond
the_ship's
ever-pitching_prow.
_There
was_an
infinity_of
firmest_fortitude,
a_determinate,
unsurrenderable_wilfulness,
in_the
fixed_and
fearless,_forward
dedication_of
that_glance.
_Not
a_word
he_spoke;
nor_did
his_officers
say_aught
to_him;
though_by
all_their
minutest_gestures
and_expressions,
they_plainly
showed_the
uneasy,_if
not_painful,
consciousness_of
being_under
a_troubled
master-eye._
And_not
only_that,
but_moody
stricken_Ahab
stood_before
them_with
a_crucifixion
in_his
face;_in
all_the
nameless_regal
overbearing_dignity
of_some
mighty_woe.
_Ere
long,_from
his_first
visit_in
the_air,
he_withdrew
into_his
cabin._
But_after
that_morning,
he_was
every_day
visible_to
the_crew;
either_standing
in_his
pivot-hole,_or
seated_upon
an_ivory
stool_he
had;_or
heavily_walking
the_deck.
_As
the_sky
grew_less
gloomy;_indeed,
began_to
grow_a
little_genial,
he_became
still_less
and_less
a_recluse;
as_if,
when_the
ship_had
sailed_from
home,_nothing
but_the
dead_wintry
bleakness_of
the_sea
had_then
kept_him
so_secluded.
_And,
by_and
by,_it
came_to
pass,_that
he_was
almost_continually
in_the
air;_but,
as_yet,
for_all
that_he
said,_or
perceptibly_did,
on_the
at_last
sunny_deck,
he_seemed
as_unnecessary
there_as
another_mast.
_But
the_Pequod
was_only
making_a
passage_now;
not_regularly
cruising;_nearly
all_whaling
preparatives_needing
supervision_the
mates_were
fully_competent
to,_so
that_there
was_little
or_nothing,
out_of
himself,_to
employ_or
excite_Ahab,
now;_and
thus_chase
away,_for
that_one
interval,_the
clouds_that
layer_upon
layer_were
piled_upon
his_brow,
as_ever
all_clouds
choose_the
loftiest_peaks
to_pile
themselves_upon.
_Nevertheless,
ere_long,
the_warm,
warbling_persuasiveness
of_the
pleasant,_holiday
weather_we
came_to,
seemed_gradually
to_charm
him_from
his_mood.
_For,
as_when
the_red-cheeked,
dancing_girls,
April_and
May,_trip
home_to
the_wintry,
misanthropic_woods;
even_the
barest,_ruggedest,
most_thunder-cloven
old_oak
will_at
least_send
forth_some
few_green
sprouts,_to
welcome_such
glad-hearted_visitants;
so_Ahab
did,_in
the_end,
a_little
respond_to
the_playful
allurings_of
that_girlish
air._
More_than
once_did
he_put
forth_the
faint_blossom
of_a
look,_which,
in_any
other_man,
would_have
soon_flowered
out_in
a_smile.
_
_CHAPTER
29_
Enter_Ahab;
to_Him,
Stubb._
_Some
days_elapsed,
and_ice
and_icebergs
all_astern,
the_Pequod
now_went
rolling_through
the_bright
Quito_spring,
which,_at
sea,_almost
perpetually_reigns
on_the
threshold_of
the_eternal
August_of
the_Tropic.
_The
warmly_cool,
clear,_ringing,
perfumed,_overflowing,
redundant_days,
were_as
crystal_goblets
of_Persian
sherbet,_heaped
up--flaked_up,
with_rose-water
snow._
The_starred
and_stately
nights_seemed
haughty_dames
in_jewelled
velvets,_nursing
at_home
in_lonely
pride,_the
memory_of
their_absent
conquering_Earls,
the_golden
helmeted_suns!
_For
sleeping_man,
'twas_hard
to_choose
between_such
winsome_days
and_such
seducing_nights.
_But
all_the
witcheries_of
that_unwaning
weather_did
not_merely
lend_new
spells_and
potencies_to
the_outward
world._
Inward_they
turned_upon
the_soul,
especially_when
the_still
mild_hours
of_eve
came_on;
then,_memory
shot_her
crystals_as
the_clear
ice_most
forms_of
noiseless_twilights.
_And
all_these
subtle_agencies,
more_and
more_they
wrought_on
Ahab's_texture.
_Old
age_is
always_wakeful;
as_if,
the_longer
linked_with
life,_the
less_man
has_to
do_with
aught_that
looks_like
death._
Among_sea-commanders,
the_old
greybeards_will
oftenest_leave
their_berths
to_visit
the_night-cloaked
deck._
It_was
so_with
Ahab;_only
that_now,
of_late,
he_seemed
so_much
to_live
in_the
open_air,
that_truly
speaking,_his
visits_were
more_to
the_cabin,
than_from
the_cabin
to_the
planks._
"It_feels
like_going
down_into
one's_tomb,"--he
would_mutter
to_himself--"for
an_old
captain_like
me_to
be_descending
this_narrow
scuttle,_to
go_to
my_grave-dug
berth."_
So,_almost
every_twenty-four
hours,_when
the_watches
of_the
night_were
set,_and
the_band
on_deck
sentinelled_the
slumbers_of
the_band
below;_and
when_if
a_rope
was_to
be_hauled
upon_the
forecastle,_the
sailors_flung
it_not
rudely_down,
as_by
day,_but
with_some
cautiousness_dropt
it_to
its_place
for_fear
of_disturbing
their_slumbering
shipmates;_when
this_sort
of_steady
quietude_would
begin_to
prevail,_habitually,
the_silent
steersman_would
watch_the
cabin-scuttle;_and
ere_long
the_old
man_would
emerge,_gripping
at_the
iron_banister,
to_help
his_crippled
way._
Some_considering
touch_of
humanity_was
in_him;
for_at
times_like
these,_he
usually_abstained
from_patrolling
the_quarter-deck;
because_to
his_wearied
mates,_seeking
repose_within
six_inches
of_his
ivory_heel,
such_would
have_been
the_reverberating
crack_and
din_of
that_bony
step,_that
their_dreams
would_have
been_on
the_crunching
teeth_of
sharks._
But_once,
the_mood
was_on
him_too
deep_for
common_regardings;
and_as
with_heavy,
lumber-like_pace
he_was
measuring_the
ship_from
taffrail_to
mainmast,_Stubb,
the_old
second_mate,
came_up
from_below,
with_a
certain_unassured,
deprecating_humorousness,
hinted_that
if_Captain
Ahab_was
pleased_to
walk_the
planks,_then,
no_one
could_say
nay;_but
there_might
be_some
way_of
muffling_the
noise;_hinting
something_indistinctly
and_hesitatingly
about_a
globe_of
tow,_and
the_insertion
into_it,
of_the
ivory_heel.
_Ah!
_Stubb,
thou_didst
not_know
Ahab_then.
_"Am
I_a
cannon-ball,_Stubb,"
said_Ahab,
"that_thou
wouldst_wad
me_that
fashion?_
But_go
thy_ways;
I_had
forgot._
Below_to
thy_nightly
grave;_where
such_as
ye_sleep
between_shrouds,
to_use
ye_to
the_filling
one_at
last.--Down,_dog,
and_kennel!"
_Starting
at_the
unforseen_concluding
exclamation_of
the_so
suddenly_scornful
old_man,
Stubb_was
speechless_a
moment;_then
said_excitedly,
"I_am
not_used
to_be
spoken_to
that_way,
sir;_I
do_but
less_than
half_like
it,_sir."
_"Avast!
gritted_Ahab
between_his
set_teeth,
and_violently
moving_away,
as_if
to_avoid
some_passionate
temptation._
"No,_sir;
not_yet,"
said_Stubb,
emboldened,_"I
will_not
tamely_be
called_a
dog,_sir."
_"Then
be_called
ten_times
a_donkey,
and_a
mule,_and
an_ass,
and_begone,
or_I'll
clear_the
world_of
thee!"_
As_he
said_this,
Ahab_advanced
upon_him
with_such
overbearing_terrors
in_his
aspect,_that
Stubb_involuntarily
retreated._
"I_was
never_served
so_before
without_giving
a_hard
blow_for
it,"_muttered
Stubb,_as
he_found
himself_descending
the_cabin-scuttle.
"It's_very
queer._
Stop,_Stubb;
somehow,_now,
I_don't
well_know
whether_to
go_back
and_strike
him,_or--what's
that?--down_here
on_my
knees_and
pray_for
him?_
Yes,_that
was_the
thought_coming
up_in
me;_but
it_would
be_the
first_time
I_ever
DID_pray.
_It's
queer;_very
queer;_and
he's_queer
too;_aye,
take_him
fore_and
aft,_he's
about_the
queerest_old
man_Stubb
ever_sailed
with._
How_he
flashed_at
me!--his_eyes
like_powder-pans!
is_he
mad?_
Anyway_there's
something_on
his_mind,
as_sure
as_there
must_be
something_on
a_deck
when_it
cracks._He
aint_in
his_bed
now,_either,
more_than
three_hours
out_of
the_twenty-four;
and_he
don't_sleep
then._
Didn't_that
Dough-Boy,_the
steward,_tell
me_that
of_a
morning_he
always_finds
the_old
man's_hammock
clothes_all
rumpled_and
tumbled,_and
the_sheets
down_at
the_foot,
and_the
coverlid_almost
tied_into
knots,_and
the_pillow
a_sort
of_frightful
hot,_as
though_a
baked_brick
had_been
on_it?
_A
hot_old
man!_
I_guess
he's_got
what_some
folks_ashore
call_a
conscience;_it's
a_kind
of_Tic-Dolly-row
they_say--worse
nor_a
toothache._
Well,_well;
I_don't
know_what
it_is,
but_the
Lord_keep
me_from
catching_it.
_He's
full_of
riddles;_I
wonder_what
he_goes
into_the
after_hold
for,_every
night,_as
Dough-Boy_tells
me_he
suspects;_what's
that_for,
I_should
like_to
know?_
Who's_made
appointments_with
him_in
the_hold?
_Ain't
that_queer,
now?_
But_there's
no_telling,
it's_the
old_game--Here
goes_for
a_snooze.
_Damn
me,_it's
worth_a
fellow's_while
to_be
born_into
the_world,
if_only
to_fall
right_asleep.
_And
now_that
I_think
of_it,
that's_about
the_first
thing_babies
do,_and
that's_a
sort_of
queer,_too.
_Damn
me,_but
all_things
are_queer,
come_to
think_of
'em._But
that's_against
my_principles.
_Think
not,_is
my_eleventh
commandment;_and
sleep_when
you_can,
is_my
twelfth--So_here
goes_again.
_But
how's_that?
didn't_he
call_me
a_dog?
blazes!_he
called_me
ten_times
a_donkey,
and_piled
a_lot
of_jackasses
on_top
of_THAT!
_He
might_as
well_have
kicked_me,
and_done
with_it.
_Maybe
he_DID
kick_me,
and_I
didn't_observe
it,_I
was_so
taken_all
aback_with
his_brow,
somehow._
It_flashed
like_a
bleached_bone.
_What
the_devil's
the_matter
with_me?
_I
don't_stand
right_on
my_legs.
_Coming
afoul_of
that_old
man_has
a_sort
of_turned
me_wrong
side_out.
_By
the_Lord,
I_must
have_been
dreaming,_though--How?
how?_how?--but
the_only
way's_to
stash_it;
so_here
goes_to
hammock_again;
and_in
the_morning,
I'll_see
how_this
plaguey_juggling
thinks_over
by_daylight."
_
_CHAPTER
30_
The_Pipe.
_
When_Stubb
had_departed,
Ahab_stood
for_a
while_leaning
over_the
bulwarks;_and
then,_as
had_been
usual_with
him_of
late,_calling
a_sailor
of_the
watch,_he
sent_him
below_for
his_ivory
stool,_and
also_his
pipe._
Lighting_the
pipe_at
the_binnacle
lamp_and
planting_the
stool_on
the_weather
side_of
the_deck,
he_sat
and_smoked.
_In
old_Norse
times,_the
thrones_of
the_sea-loving
Danish_kings
were_fabricated,
saith_tradition,
of_the
tusks_of
the_narwhale.
_How
could_one
look_at
Ahab_then,
seated_on
that_tripod
of_bones,
without_bethinking
him_of
the_royalty
it_symbolized?
_For
a_Khan
of_the
plank,_and
a_king
of_the
sea,_and
a_great
lord_of
Leviathans_was
Ahab._
Some_moments
passed,_during
which_the
thick_vapour
came_from
his_mouth
in_quick
and_constant
puffs,_which
blew_back
again_into
his_face.
"How_now,"
he_soliloquized
at_last,
withdrawing_the
tube,_"this
smoking_no
longer_soothes.
_Oh,
my_pipe!
hard_must
it_go
with_me
if_thy
charm_be
gone!_
Here_have
I_been
unconsciously_toiling,
not_pleasuring--aye,
and_ignorantly
smoking_to
windward_all
the_while;
to_windward,
and_with
such_nervous
whiffs,_as
if,_like
the_dying
whale,_my
final_jets
were_the
strongest_and
fullest_of
trouble._
What_business
have_I
with_this
pipe?_
This_thing
that_is
meant_for
sereneness,_to
send_up
mild_white
vapours_among
mild_white
hairs,_not
among_torn
iron-grey_locks
like_mine.
_I'll
smoke_no
more--"_
He_tossed
the_still
lighted_pipe
into_the
sea._
The_fire
hissed_in
the_waves;
the_same
instant_the
ship_shot
by_the
bubble_the
sinking_pipe
made._
With_slouched
hat,_Ahab
lurchingly_paced
the_planks.
_
_CHAPTER
31_
Queen_Mab.
_
Next_morning
Stubb_accosted
Flask._
"Such_a
queer_dream,
King-Post,_I
never_had.
_You
know_the
old_man's
ivory_leg,
well_I
dreamed_he
kicked_me
with_it;
and_when
I_tried
to_kick
back,_upon
my_soul,
my_little
man,_I
kicked_my
leg_right
off!_And
then,_presto!
_Ahab
seemed_a
pyramid,_and
I,_like
a_blazing
fool,_kept
kicking_at
it._
But_what
was_still
more_curious,
Flask--you_know
how_curious
all_dreams
are--through_all
this_rage
that_I
was_in,
I_somehow
seemed_to
be_thinking
to_myself,
that_after
all,_it
was_not
much_of
an_insult,
that_kick
from_Ahab.
_'Why,'
thinks_I,
'what's_the
row?_
It's_not
a_real
leg,_only
a_false
leg.'_
And_there's
a_mighty
difference_between
a_living
thump_and
a_dead
thump._
That's_what
makes_a
blow_from
the_hand,
Flask,_fifty
times_more
savage_to
bear_than
a_blow
from_a
cane._
The_living
member--that_makes
the_living
insult,_my
little_man.
_And
thinks_I
to_myself
all_the
while,_mind,
while_I
was_stubbing
my_silly
toes_against
that_cursed
pyramid--so_confoundedly
contradictory_was
it_all,
all_the
while,_I
say,_I
was_thinking
to_myself,
'what's_his
leg_now,
but_a
cane--a_whalebone
cane._
Yes,'_thinks
I,_'it
was_only
a_playful
cudgelling--in_fact,
only_a
whaleboning_that
he_gave
me--not_a
base_kick.
_Besides,'
thinks_I,
'look_at
it_once;
why,_the
end_of
it--the_foot
part--what_a
small_sort
of_end
it_is;
whereas,_if
a_broad
footed_farmer
kicked_me,
THERE'S_a
devilish_broad
insult._
But_this
insult_is
whittled_down
to_a
point_only.'
_But
now_comes
the_greatest
joke_of
the_dream,
Flask._While
I_was
battering_away
at_the
pyramid,_a
sort_of
badger-haired_old
merman,_with
a_hump
on_his
back,_takes
me_by
the_shoulders,
and_slews
me_round.
_'What
are_you
'bout?'_says
he._
Slid!_man,
but_I
was_frightened.
_Such
a_phiz!
_But,
somehow,_next
moment_I
was_over
the_fright.
_'What
am_I
about?'_says
I_at
last._
'And_what
business_is
that_of
yours,_I
should_like
to_know,
Mr._Humpback?
_Do
YOU_want
a_kick?'
_By
the_lord,
Flask,_I
had_no
sooner_said
that,_than
he_turned
round_his
stern_to
me,_bent
over,_and
dragging_up
a_lot
of_seaweed
he_had
for_a
clout--what_do
you_think,
I_saw?--why
thunder_alive,
man,_his
stern_was
stuck_full
of_marlinspikes,
with_the
points_out.
_Says
I,_on
second_thoughts,
'I_guess
I_won't
kick_you,
old_fellow.'
_'Wise
Stubb,'_said
he,_'wise
Stubb;'_and
kept_muttering
it_all
the_time,
a_sort
of_eating
of_his
own_gums
like_a
chimney_hag.
_Seeing
he_wasn't
going_to
stop_saying
over_his
'wise_Stubb,
wise_Stubb,'
I_thought
I_might
as_well
fall_to
kicking_the
pyramid_again.
_But
I_had
only_just
lifted_my
foot_for
it,_when
he_roared
out,_'Stop
that_kicking!'
'Halloa,'_says
I,_'what's
the_matter
now,_old
fellow?'_
'Look_ye
here,'_says
he;_'let's
argue_the
insult._
Captain_Ahab
kicked_ye,
didn't_he?'
_'Yes,
he_did,'
says_I--'right
HERE_it
was.'_
'Very_good,'
says_he--'he
used_his
ivory_leg,
didn't_he?'
_'Yes,
he_did,'
says_I.
_'Well
then,'_says
he,_'wise
Stubb,_what
have_you
to_complain
of?_
Didn't_he
kick_with
right_good
will?_it
wasn't_a
common_pitch
pine_leg
he_kicked
with,_was
it?_
No,_you
were_kicked
by_a
great_man,
and_with
a_beautiful
ivory_leg,
Stubb._
It's_an
honour;_I
consider_it
an_honour.
_Listen,
wise_Stubb.
_In
old_England
the_greatest
lords_think
it_great
glory_to
be_slapped
by_a
queen,_and
made_garter-knights
of;_but,
be_YOUR
boast,_Stubb,
that_ye
were_kicked
by_old
Ahab,_and
made_a
wise_man
of._
Remember_what
I_say;
BE_kicked
by_him;
account_his
kicks_honours;
and_on
no_account
kick_back;
for_you
can't_help
yourself,_wise
Stubb._
Don't_you
see_that
pyramid?'_
With_that,
he_all
of_a
sudden_seemed
somehow,_in
some_queer
fashion,_to
swim_off
into_the
air._
I_snored;
rolled_over;
and_there
I_was
in_my
hammock!_
Now,_what
do_you
think_of
that_dream,
Flask?"_
"I_don't
know;_it
seems_a
sort_of
foolish_to
me,_tho.'"
_"May
be;_may
be._
But_it's
made_a
wise_man
of_me,
Flask._
D'ye_see
Ahab_standing
there,_sideways
looking_over
the_stern?
_Well,
the_best
thing_you
can_do,
Flask,_is
to_let
the_old
man_alone;
never_speak
to_him,
whatever_he
says._
Halloa!_
What's_that
he_shouts?
_Hark!"
_"Mast-head,
there!_
Look_sharp,
all_of
ye!_
There_are
whales_hereabouts!
_If
ye_see
a_white
one,_split
your_lungs
for_him!
_"What
do_you
think_of
that_now,
Flask?_ain't
there_a
small_drop
of_something
queer_about
that,_eh?
_A
white_whale--did
ye_mark
that,_man?
_Look
ye--there's_something
special_in
the_wind.
_Stand
by_for
it,_Flask.
_Ahab
has_that
that's_bloody
on_his
mind._
But,_mum;
he_comes
this_way."

_Already
we_are

which_are
to_follow.
_It
is_some
systematized_exhibition
of_the
whale_in
his_broad
genera,_that
I_would
now_fain
put_before
you._
Yet_is
it_no
easy_task.
_The
classification_of
the_constituents
of_a
chaos,_nothing
less_is
here_essayed.
_Listen
to_what
the_best
and_latest
authorities_have
laid_down.
_"No
branch_of
Zoology_is
so_much
involved_as
that_which
is_entitled
Cetology,"_says
Captain_Scoresby,
A.D._1820.
_"It
is_not
my_intention,
were_it
in_my
power,_to
enter_into
the_inquiry
as_to
the_true
method_of
dividing_the
cetacea_into
groups_and
families...._
Utter_confusion
exists_among
the_historians
of_this
animal"_(sperm
whale),_says
Surgeon_Beale,
A.D._1839.
_"Unfitness
to_pursue
our_research
in_the
unfathomable_waters."
"Impenetrable_veil
covering_our
knowledge_of
the_cetacea."
_"A
field_strewn
with_thorns."
_"All
these_incomplete
indications_but
serve_to
torture_us
naturalists."_
Thus_speak
of_the
whale,_the
great_Cuvier,
and_John
Hunter,_and
Lesson,_those
lights_of
zoology_and
anatomy._
Nevertheless,_though
of_real
knowledge_there
be_little,
yet_of
books_there
are_a
plenty;_and
so_in
some_small
degree,_with
cetology,_or
the_science
of_whales.
Many_are
the_men,
small_and
great,_old
and_new,
landsmen_and
seamen,_who
have_at
large_or
in_little,
written_of
the_whale.
_Run
over_a
few:--The_Authors
of_the
Bible;_Aristotle;
Pliny;_Aldrovandi;
Sir_Thomas
Browne;_Gesner;
Ray;_Linnaeus;
Rondeletius;_Willoughby;
Green;_Artedi;
Sibbald;_Brisson;
Marten;_Lacepede;
Bonneterre;_Desmarest;
Baron_Cuvier;
Frederick_Cuvier;
John_Hunter;
Owen;_Scoresby;
Beale;_Bennett;
J._
Ross_Browne;
the_Author
of_Miriam
Coffin;_Olmstead;
and_the
Rev._
T._
Cheever._
But_to
what_ultimate
generalizing_purpose
all_these
have_written,
the_above
cited_extracts
will_show.
_Of
the_names
in_this
list_of
whale_authors,
only_those
following_Owen
ever_saw
living_whales;
and_but
one_of
them_was
a_real
professional_harpooneer
and_whaleman.
_I
mean_Captain
Scoresby._
On_the
separate_subject
of_the
Greenland_or
right-whale,_he
is_the
best_existing
authority._
But_Scoresby
knew_nothing
and_says
nothing_of
the_great
sperm_whale,
compared_with
which_the
Greenland_whale
is_almost
unworthy_mentioning.
_And
here_be
it_said,
that_the
Greenland_whale
is_an
usurper_upon
the_throne
of_the
seas._
He_is
not_even
by_any
means_the
largest_of
the_whales.
_Yet,
owing_to
the_long
priority_of
his_claims,
and_the
profound_ignorance
which,_till
some_seventy
years_back,
invested_the
then_fabulous
or_utterly
unknown_sperm-whale,
and_which
ignorance_to
this_present
day_still
reigns_in
all_but
some_few
scientific_retreats
and_whale-ports;
this_usurpation
has_been
every_way
complete._
Reference_to
nearly_all
the_leviathanic
allusions_in
the_great
poets_of
past_days,
will_satisfy
you_that
the_Greenland
whale,_without
one_rival,
was_to
them_the
monarch_of
the_seas.
_But
the_time
has_at
last_come
for_a
new_proclamation.
_This
is_Charing
Cross;_hear
ye!_good
people_all,--the
Greenland_whale
is_deposed,--the
great_sperm
whale_now
reigneth!_
There_are
only_two
books_in
being_which
at_all
pretend_to
put_the
living_sperm
whale_before
you,_and
at_the
same_time,
in_the
remotest_degree
succeed_in
the_attempt.
_Those
books_are
Beale's_and
Bennett's;_both
in_their
time_surgeons
to_English
South-Sea_whale-ships,
and_both
exact_and
reliable_men.
_The
original_matter
touching_the
sperm_whale
to_be
found_in
their_volumes
is_necessarily
small;_but
so_far
as_it
goes,_it
is_of
excellent_quality,
though_mostly
confined_to
scientific_description.
_As
yet,_however,
the_sperm
whale,_scientific
or_poetic,
lives_not
complete_in
any_literature.
_Far
above_all
other_hunted
whales,_his
is_an
unwritten_life.
_Now
the_various
species_of
whales_need
some_sort
of_popular
comprehensive_classification,
if_only
an_easy
outline_one
for_the
present,_hereafter
to_be
filled_in
all_its
departments_by
subsequent_laborers.
_As
no_better
man_advances
to_take
this_matter
in_hand,
I_hereupon
offer_my
own_poor
endeavors._
I_promise
nothing_complete;
because_any
human_thing
supposed_to
be_complete,
must_for
that_very
reason_infallibly
be_faulty.
_I
shall_not
pretend_to
a_minute
anatomical_description
of_the
various_species,
or--in_this
place_at
least--to_much
of_any
description._
My_object
here_is
simply_to
project_the
draught_of
a_systematization
of_cetology.
_I
am_the
architect,_not
the_builder.
_But
it_is
a_ponderous
task;_no
ordinary_letter-sorter
in_the
Post-Office_is
equal_to
it._
To_grope
down_into
the_bottom
of_the
sea_after
them;_to
have_one's
hands_among
the_unspeakable
foundations,_ribs,
and_very
pelvis_of
the_world;
this_is
a_fearful
thing._
What_am
I_that
I_should
essay_to
hook_the
nose_of
this_leviathan!
_The
awful_tauntings
in_Job
might_well
appal_me.
_"Will
he_the
(leviathan)_make
a_covenant
with_thee?
_Behold
the_hope
of_him
is_vain!
_But
I_have
swam_through
libraries_and
sailed_through
oceans;_I
have_had
to_do
with_whales
with_these
visible_hands;
I_am
in_earnest;
and_I
will_try.
_There
are_some
preliminaries_to
settle._
First:_The
uncertain,_unsettled
condition_of
this_science
of_Cetology
is_in
the_very
vestibule_attested
by_the
fact,_that
in_some
quarters_it
still_remains
a_moot
point_whether
a_whale
be_a
fish._
In_his
System_of
Nature,_A.D.
1776,_Linnaeus
declares,_"I
hereby_separate
the_whales
from_the
fish."_
But_of
my_own
knowledge,_I
know_that
down_to
the_year
1850,_sharks
and_shad,
alewives_and
herring,_against
Linnaeus's_express
edict,_were
still_found
dividing_the
possession_of
the_same
seas_with
the_Leviathan.
_The
grounds_upon
which_Linnaeus
would_fain
have_banished
the_whales
from_the
waters,_he
states_as
follows:_"On
account_of
their_warm
bilocular_heart,
their_lungs,
their_movable
eyelids,_their
hollow_ears,
penem_intrantem
feminam_mammis
lactantem,"_and
finally,_"ex
lege_naturae
jure_meritoque."
_I
submitted_all
this_to
my_friends
Simeon_Macey
and_Charley
Coffin,_of
Nantucket,_both
messmates_of
mine_in
a_certain
voyage,_and
they_united
in_the
opinion_that
the_reasons
set_forth
were_altogether
insufficient._
Charley_profanely
hinted_they
were_humbug.
_Be
it_known
that,_waiving
all_argument,
I_take
the_good
old_fashioned
ground_that
the_whale
is_a
fish,_and
call_upon
holy_Jonah
to_back
me._This
fundamental_thing
settled,_the
next_point
is,_in
what_internal
respect_does
the_whale
differ_from
other_fish.
_Above,
Linnaeus_has
given_you
those_items.
_But
in_brief,
they_are
these:_lungs
and_warm
blood;_whereas,
all_other
fish_are
lungless_and
cold_blooded.
_Next:
how_shall
we_define
the_whale,
by_his
obvious_externals,
so_as
conspicuously_to
label_him
for_all
time_to
come?_
To_be
short,_then,
a_whale
is_A
SPOUTING_FISH
WITH_A
HORIZONTAL_TAIL.
_There
you_have
him._
However_contracted,
that_definition
is_the
result_of
expanded_meditation.
_A
walrus_spouts
much_like
a_whale,
but_the
walrus_is
not_a
fish,_because
he_is
amphibious._
But_the
last_term
of_the
definition_is
still_more
cogent,_as
coupled_with
the_first.
_Almost
any_one
must_have
noticed_that
all_the
fish_familiar
to_landsmen
have_not
a_flat,
but_a
vertical,_or
up-and-down_tail.
_Whereas,
among_spouting
fish_the
tail,_though
it_may
be_similarly
shaped,_invariably
assumes_a
horizontal_position.
_By
the_above
definition_of
what_a
whale_is,
I_do
by_no
means_exclude
from_the
leviathanic_brotherhood
any_sea
creature_hitherto
identified_with
the_whale
by_the
best_informed
Nantucketers;_nor,
on_the
other_hand,
link_with
it_any
fish_hitherto
authoritatively_regarded
as_alien.*
_Hence,
all_the
smaller,_spouting,
and_horizontal
tailed_fish
must_be
included_in
this_ground-plan
of_Cetology.
_Now,
then,_come
the_grand
divisions_of
the_entire
whale_host.
_
*I_am
aware_that
down_to
the_present
time,_the
fish_styled
Lamatins_and
Dugongs_(Pig-fish
and_Sow-fish
of_the
Coffins_of
Nantucket)_are
included_by
many_naturalists
among_the
whales._
But_as
these_pig-fish
are_a
noisy,_contemptible
set,_mostly
lurking_in
the_mouths
of_rivers,
and_feeding
on_wet
hay,_and
especially_as
they_do
not_spout,
I_deny
their_credentials
as_whales;
and_have
presented_them
with_their
passports_to
quit_the
Kingdom_of
Cetology._
_First:
According_to
magnitude_I
divide_the
whales_into
three_primary
BOOKS_(subdivisible
into_CHAPTERS),
and_these
shall_comprehend
them_all,
both_small
and_large.

BOOK_I.
(FOLIO),_CHAPTER
I._(SPERM
WHALE).--This_whale,
among_the
English_of
old_vaguely
known_as
the_Trumpa
whale,_and
the_Physeter
whale,_and
the_Anvil
Headed_whale,
is_the
present_Cachalot
of_the
French,_and
the_Pottsfich
of_the
Germans,_and
the_Macrocephalus
of_the
Long_Words.
_He
is,_without
doubt,_the
largest_inhabitant
of_the
globe;_the
most_formidable
of_all
whales_to
encounter;_the
most_majestic
in_aspect;
and_lastly,
by_far
the_most
valuable_in
commerce;_he
being_the
only_creature
from_which
that_valuable
substance,_spermaceti,
is_obtained.
_All
his_peculiarities
will,_in
many_other
places,_be
enlarged_upon.
_It
is_chiefly
with_his
name_that
I_now
have_to
do._
Philologically_considered,
it_is
absurd._
Some_centuries
ago,_when
the_Sperm
whale_was
almost_wholly
unknown_in
his_own
proper_individuality,
and_when
his_oil
was_only
accidentally_obtained
from_the
stranded_fish;
in_those
days_spermaceti,
it_would
seem,_was
popularly_supposed
to_be
derived_from
a_creature
identical_with
the_one
then_known
in_England
as_the
Greenland_or
Right_Whale.
_It
was_the
idea_also,
that_this
same_spermaceti
was_that
quickening_humor
of_the
Greenland_Whale
which_the
first_syllable
of_the
word_literally
expresses._
In_those
times,_also,
spermaceti_was
exceedingly_scarce,
not_being
used_for
light,_but
only_as
an_ointment
and_medicament.
_It
was_only
to_be
had_from
the_druggists
as_you
nowadays_buy
an_ounce
of_rhubarb.
_When,
as_I
opine,_in
the_course
of_time,
the_true
nature_of
spermaceti_became
known,_its
original_name
was_still
retained_by
the_dealers;
no_doubt
to_enhance
its_value
by_a
notion_so
strangely_significant
of_its
scarcity._
And_so
the_appellation
must_at
last_have
come_to
be_bestowed
upon_the
whale_from
which_this
spermaceti_was
really_derived.

CHAPTER_II.
(RIGHT_WHALE).--In
one_respect
this_is
the_most
venerable_of
the_leviathans,
being_the
one_first
regularly_hunted
by_man.
_It
yields_the
article_commonly
known_as
whalebone_or
baleen;_and
the_oil
specially_known
as_"whale
oil,"_an
inferior_article
in_commerce.
_Among
the_fishermen,
he_is
indiscriminately_designated
by_all
the_following
titles:_The
Whale;_the
Greenland_Whale;
the_Black
Whale;_the
Great_Whale;
the_True
Whale;_the
Right_Whale.
_There
is_a
deal_of
obscurity_concerning
the_identity
of_the
species_thus
multitudinously_baptised.
_What
then_is
the_whale,
which_I
include_in
the_second
species_of
my_Folios?
_It
is_the
Great_Mysticetus
of_the
English_naturalists;
the_Greenland
Whale_of
the_English
whalemen;_the
Baliene_Ordinaire
of_the
French_whalemen;
the_Growlands
Walfish_of
the_Swedes.
_It
is_the
whale_which
for_more
than_two
centuries_past
has_been
hunted_by
the_Dutch
and_English
in_the
Arctic_seas;
it_is
the_whale
which_the
American_fishermen
have_long
pursued_in
the_Indian
ocean,_on
the_Brazil
Banks,_on
the_Nor'
West_Coast,
and_various
other_parts
of_the
world,_designated
by_them
Right_Whale
Cruising_Grounds.
_Some
pretend_to
see_a
difference_between
the_Greenland
whale_of
the_English
and_the
right_whale
of_the
Americans._
But_they
precisely_agree
in_all
their_grand
features;_nor
has_there
yet_been
presented_a
single_determinate
fact_upon
which_to
ground_a
radical_distinction.
It_is
by_endless
subdivisions_based
upon_the
most_inconclusive
differences,_that
some_departments
of_natural
history_become
so_repellingly
intricate._
The_right
whale_will
be_elsewhere
treated_of
at_some
length,_with
reference_to
elucidating_the
sperm_whale.
_BOOK
I._(FOLIO),
CHAPTER_III.
(FIN-BACK).--Under_this
head_I
reckon_a
monster_which,
by_the
various_names
of_Fin-Back,
Tall-Spout,_and
Long-John,_has
been_seen
almost_in
every_sea
and_is
commonly_the
whale_whose
distant_jet
is_so
often_descried
by_passengers
crossing_the
Atlantic,_in
the_New
York_packet-tracks.
_In
the_length
he_attains,
and_in
his_baleen,
the_Fin-back
resembles_the
right_whale,
but_is
of_a
less_portly
girth,_and
a_lighter
colour,_approaching
to_olive.
_His
great_lips
present_a
cable-like_aspect,
formed_by
the_intertwisting,
slanting_folds
of_large
wrinkles._
His_grand
distinguishing_feature,
the_fin,
from_which
he_derives
his_name,
is_often
a_conspicuous
object._
This_fin
is_some
three_or
four_feet
long,_growing
vertically_from
the_hinder
part_of
the_back,
of_an
angular_shape,
and_with
a_very
sharp_pointed
end._
Even_if
not_the
slightest_other
part_of
the_creature
be_visible,
this_isolated
fin_will,
at_times,
be_seen
plainly_projecting
from_the
surface._
When_the
sea_is
moderately_calm,
and_slightly
marked_with
spherical_ripples,
and_this
gnomon-like_fin
stands_up
and_casts
shadows_upon
the_wrinkled
surface,_it
may_well
be_supposed
that_the
watery_circle
surrounding_it
somewhat_resembles
a_dial,
with_its
style_and
wavy_hour-lines
graved_on
it._
On_that
Ahaz-dial_the
shadow_often
goes_back.
_The
Fin-Back_is
not_gregarious.
_He
seems_a
whale-hater,_as
some_men
are_man-haters.
_Very
shy;_always
going_solitary;
unexpectedly_rising
to_the
surface_in
the_remotest
and_most
sullen_waters;
his_straight
and_single
lofty_jet
rising_like
a_tall
misanthropic_spear
upon_a
barren_plain;
gifted_with
such_wondrous
power_and
velocity_in
swimming,_as
to_defy
all_present
pursuit_from
man;_this
leviathan_seems
the_banished
and_unconquerable
Cain_of
his_race,
bearing_for
his_mark
that_style
upon_his
back._
From_having
the_baleen
in_his
mouth,_the
Fin-Back_is
sometimes_included
with_the
right_whale,
among_a
theoretic_species
denominated_WHALEBONE
WHALES,_that
is,_whales
with_baleen.
_Of
these_so
called_Whalebone
whales,_there
would_seem
to_be
several_varieties,
most_of
which,_however,
are_little
known._
Broad-nosed_whales
and_beaked
whales;_pike-headed
whales;_bunched
whales;_under-jawed
whales_and
rostrated_whales,
are_the
fishermen's_names
for_a
few_sorts.
_In
connection_with
this_appellative
of_"Whalebone
whales,"_it
is_of
great_importance
to_mention,
that_however
such_a
nomenclature_may
be_convenient
in_facilitating
allusions_to
some_kind
of_whales,
yet_it
is_in
vain_to
attempt_a
clear_classification
of_the
Leviathan,_founded
upon_either
his_baleen,
or_hump,
or_fin,
or_teeth;
notwithstanding_that
those_marked
parts_or
features_very
obviously_seem
better_adapted
to_afford
the_basis
for_a
regular_system
of_Cetology
than_any
other_detached
bodily_distinctions,
which_the
whale,_in
his_kinds,
presents._
How_then?
_The
baleen,_hump,
back-fin,_and
teeth;_these
are_things
whose_peculiarities
are_indiscriminately
dispersed_among
all_sorts
of_whales,
without_any
regard_to
what_may
be_the
nature_of
their_structure
in_other
and_more
essential_particulars.
_Thus,
the_sperm
whale_and
the_humpbacked
whale,_each
has_a
hump;_but
there_the
similitude_ceases.
_Then,
this_same
humpbacked_whale
and_the
Greenland_whale,
each_of
these_has
baleen;_but
there_again
the_similitude
ceases._
And_it
is_just
the_same
with_the
other_parts
above_mentioned.
_In
various_sorts
of_whales,
they_form
such_irregular
combinations;_or,
in_the
case_of
any_one
of_them
detached,_such
an_irregular
isolation;_as
utterly_to
defy_all
general_methodization
formed_upon
such_a
basis._
On_this
rock_every
one_of
the_whale-naturalists
has_split.
_But
it_may
possibly_be
conceived_that,
in_the
internal_parts
of_the
whale,_in
his_anatomy--there,
at_least,
we_shall
be_able
to_hit
the_right
classification._
Nay;_what
thing,_for
example,_is
there_in
the_Greenland
whale's_anatomy
more_striking
than_his
baleen?_
Yet_we
have_seen
that_by
his_baleen
it_is
impossible_correctly
to_classify
the_Greenland
whale._
And_if
you_descend
into_the
bowels_of
the_various
leviathans,_why
there_you
will_not
find_distinctions
a_fiftieth
part_as
available_to
the_systematizer
as_those
external_ones
already_enumerated.
_What
then_remains?
nothing_but
to_take
hold_of
the_whales
bodily,_in
their_entire
liberal_volume,
and_boldly
sort_them
that_way.
_And
this_is
the_Bibliographical
system_here
adopted;_and
it_is
the_only
one_that
can_possibly
succeed,_for
it_alone
is_practicable.
_To
proceed._

(FOLIO)_CHAPTER
IV._(HUMP-BACK).--This
whale_is
often_seen
on_the
northern_American
coast._
He_has
been_frequently
captured_there,
and_towed
into_harbor.
_He
has_a
great_pack
on_him
like_a
peddler;_or
you_might
call_him
the_Elephant
and_Castle
whale._
At_any
rate,_the
popular_name
for_him
does_not
sufficiently_distinguish
him,_since
the_sperm
whale_also
has_a
hump_though
a_smaller
one._
His_oil
is_not
very_valuable.
_He
has_baleen.
_He
is_the
most_gamesome
and_light-hearted
of_all
the_whales,
making_more
gay_foam
and_white
water_generally
than_any
other_of
them._
BOOK_I.

this_whale
little_is
known_but
his_name.
_I

him_at

off_Cape
Horn._
Of_a
retiring_nature,
he_eludes
both_hunters
and_philosophers.
_Though
no_coward,
he_has
never_yet
shown_any
part_of
him_but
his_back,
which_rises
in_a
long_sharp
ridge._
Let_him
go._
I_know
little_more
of_him,
nor_does
anybody_else.

(SULPHUR-BOTTOM).--Another_retiring
gentleman,_with
a_brimstone
belly,_doubtless
got_by
scraping_along

some_of
his_profounder
divings._
He_is
seldom_seen;
at_least
I_have
never_seen
him_except
in_the
remoter_southern
seas,_and
then_always
at_too
great_a
distance_to
study_his
countenance._
He_is
never_chased;
he_would
run_away
with_rope-walks
of_line.
_Prodigies
are_told
of_him.
_Adieu,
Sulphur_Bottom!
_I
can_say

true_of
ye,_nor

_Thus
ends_BOOK
I._(FOLIO),
and_now
begins_BOOK
II._(OCTAVO).
_OCTAVOES.*--These
embrace_the
whales_of
middling_magnitude,
among_which
present_may
be_numbered:--I.,
the_GRAMPUS;
II.,_the
BLACK_FISH;
III.,_the
NARWHALE;_IV.,
the_THRASHER;
V.,_the
KILLER._
_*Why
this_book
of_whales
is_not
denominated_the
Quarto_is
very_plain.
Because,_while
the_whales
of_this
order,_though
smaller_than
those_of
the_former
order,_nevertheless
retain_a
proportionate_likeness
to_them
in_figure,
yet_the
bookbinder's_Quarto
volume_in
its_dimensioned
form_does
not_preserve
the_shape
of_the
Folio_volume,
but_the
Octavo_volume
does._
_BOOK
II._(OCTAVO),
CHAPTER_I.
(GRAMPUS).--Though_this
fish,_whose
loud_sonorous
breathing,_or
rather_blowing,
has_furnished
a_proverb
to_landsmen,
is_so
well_known
a_denizen
of_the
deep,_yet
is_he
not_popularly
classed_among
whales._
But_possessing
all_the
grand_distinctive
features_of
the_leviathan,
most_naturalists
have_recognised
him_for
one._
He_is
of_moderate
octavo_size,
varying_from
fifteen_to
twenty-five_feet
in_length,
and_of
corresponding_dimensions
round_the
waist._
He_swims
in_herds;
he_is
never_regularly
hunted,_though
his_oil
is_considerable
in_quantity,
and_pretty
good_for
light._
By_some
fishermen_his
approach_is
regarded_as
premonitory_of
the_advance
of_the
great_sperm
whale._
BOOK_II.
(OCTAVO),_CHAPTER
II._(BLACK
FISH).--I_give
the_popular
fishermen's_names
for_all
these_fish,
for_generally
they_are
the_best.
_Where
any_name
happens_to
be_vague
or_inexpressive,
I_shall
say_so,
and_suggest
another._
I_do
so_now,
touching_the
Black_Fish,
so-called,_because
blackness_is
the_rule
among_almost
all_whales.
So,_call
him_the
Hyena_Whale,
if_you
please._
His_voracity
is_well
known,_and
from_the
circumstance_that
the_inner
angles_of
his_lips
are_curved
upwards,_he
carries_an
everlasting_Mephistophelean
grin_on
his_face.
_This
whale_averages
some_sixteen
or_eighteen
feet_in
length._
He_is
found_in
almost_all
latitudes._
He_has
a_peculiar
way_of
showing_his
dorsal_hooked
fin_in
swimming,_which
looks_something
like_a
Roman_nose.
_When
not_more
profitably_employed,
the_sperm
whale_hunters
sometimes_capture
the_Hyena
whale,_to
keep_up
the_supply
of_cheap
oil_for
domestic_employment--as
some_frugal
housekeepers,_in
the_absence
of_company,
and_quite
alone_by
themselves,_burn
unsavory_tallow
instead_of
odorous_wax.
_Though
their_blubber
is_very
thin,_some
of_these
whales_will
yield_you
upwards_of
thirty_gallons
of_oil.
_BOOK
II._(OCTAVO),
CHAPTER_III.
(NARWHALE),_that
is,_NOSTRIL
WHALE.--Another_instance
of_a
curiously_named
whale,_so
named_I
suppose_from
his_peculiar
horn_being
originally_mistaken
for_a
peaked_nose.
_The
creature_is
some_sixteen
feet_in
length,_while
its_horn
averages_five
feet,_though
some_exceed
ten,_and
even_attain
to_fifteen
feet._
Strictly_speaking,
this_horn
is_but
a_lengthened
tusk,_growing
out_from
the_jaw
in_a
line_a
little_depressed
from_the
horizontal._
But_it
is_only
found_on
the_sinister
side,_which
has_an
ill_effect,
giving_its
owner_something
analogous_to
the_aspect
of_a
clumsy_left-handed
man._
What_precise
purpose_this
ivory_horn
or_lance
answers,_it
would_be
hard_to
say._
It_does
not_seem
to_be
used_like
the_blade
of_the
sword-fish_and
bill-fish;_though
some_sailors
tell_me
that_the
Narwhale_employs
it_for
a_rake
in_turning
over_the
bottom_of
the_sea
for_food.
_Charley
Coffin_said
it_was
used_for
an_ice-piercer;
for_the
Narwhale,_rising
to_the
surface_of
the_Polar
Sea,_and
finding_it
sheeted_with
ice,_thrusts
his_horn
up,_and
so_breaks
through._
But_you
cannot_prove
either_of
these_surmises
to_be
correct._
My_own
opinion_is,
that_however
this_one-sided
horn_may
really_be
used_by
the_Narwhale--however
that_may
be--it_would
certainly_be
very_convenient
to_him
for_a
folder_in
reading_pamphlets.
_The
Narwhale_I
have_heard
called_the
Tusked_whale,
the_Horned
whale,_and
the_Unicorn
whale._
He_is
certainly_a
curious_example
of_the
Unicornism_to
be_found
in_almost
every_kingdom
of_animated
nature._
From_certain
cloistered_old
authors_I
have_gathered
that_this
same_sea-unicorn's
horn_was
in_ancient
days_regarded
as_the
great_antidote
against_poison,
and_as
such,_preparations
of_it
brought_immense
prices._
It_was
also_distilled
to_a
volatile_salts
for_fainting
ladies,_the
same_way
that_the
horns_of
the_male
deer_are
manufactured_into
hartshorn._
Originally_it
was_in
itself_accounted
an_object
of_great
curiosity._
Black_Letter
tells_me
that_Sir
Martin_Frobisher
on_his
return_from
that_voyage,
when_Queen
Bess_did
gallantly_wave
her_jewelled
hand_to
him_from
a_window
of_Greenwich
Palace,_as
his_bold
ship_sailed
down_the
Thames;_"when
Sir_Martin
returned_from
that_voyage,"
saith_Black
Letter,_"on
bended_knees
he_presented
to_her
highness_a
prodigious_long
horn_of
the_Narwhale,
which_for
a_long
period_after
hung_in
the_castle
at_Windsor."
_An
Irish_author
avers_that
the_Earl
of_Leicester,
on_bended
knees,_did
likewise_present
to_her
highness_another
horn,_pertaining
to_a
land_beast
of_the
unicorn_nature.
_The
Narwhale_has
a_very
picturesque,_leopard-like
look,_being
of_a
milk-white_ground
colour,_dotted
with_round
and_oblong
spots_of
black._His
oil_is
very_superior,
clear_and
fine;_but
there_is
little_of
it,_and
he_is
seldom_hunted.
_He
is_mostly
found_in
the_circumpolar
seas._
BOOK_II.
(OCTAVO),_CHAPTER
IV._(KILLER).--Of
this_whale
little_is
precisely_known
to_the
Nantucketer,_and
nothing_at
all_to
the_professed
naturalist._
From_what
I_have
seen_of
him_at
a_distance,
I_should
say_that
he_was
about_the
bigness_of
a_grampus.
_He
is_very
savage--a_sort
of_Feegee
fish._
He_sometimes
takes_the
great_Folio
whales_by
the_lip,
and_hangs
there_like
a_leech,
till_the
mighty_brute
is_worried
to_death.
_The
Killer_is
never_hunted.
_I
never_heard
what_sort
of_oil
he_has.
_Exception
might_be
taken_to
the_name
bestowed_upon
this_whale,
on_the
ground_of
its_indistinctness.
_For
we_are
all_killers,
on_land
and_on
sea;_Bonapartes
and_Sharks
included._
BOOK_II.
(OCTAVO),_CHAPTER
V._(THRASHER).--This
gentleman_is
famous_for
his_tail,
which_he
uses_for
a_ferule
in_thrashing
his_foes.
_He
mounts_the
Folio_whale's
back,_and
as_he
swims,_he
works_his
passage_by
flogging_him;
as_some
schoolmasters_get
along_in
the_world
by_a
similar_process.
_Still
less_is
known_of
the_Thrasher
than_of
the_Killer.
_Both
are_outlaws,
even_in
the_lawless
seas._
Thus_ends
BOOK_II.
(OCTAVO),_and
begins_BOOK
III._(DUODECIMO).
_DUODECIMOES.--These
include_the
smaller_whales.
_I.
The_Huzza
Porpoise._
II._The
Algerine_Porpoise.
_III.
The_Mealy-mouthed
Porpoise._
To_those
who_have
not_chanced
specially_to
study_the
subject,_it
may_possibly
seem_strange,
that_fishes
not_commonly
exceeding_four
or_five
feet_should
be_marshalled
among_WHALES--a
word,_which,
in_the
popular_sense,
always_conveys
an_idea
of_hugeness.
_But
the_creatures
set_down
above_as
Duodecimoes_are
infallibly_whales,
by_the
terms_of
my_definition
of_what
a_whale
is--i.e._a
spouting_fish,
with_a
horizontal_tail.
_BOOK
III._(DUODECIMO),
CHAPTER_1.
(HUZZA_PORPOISE).--This
is_the
common_porpoise
found_almost
all_over
the_globe.
_The
name_is
of_my
own_bestowal;
for_there
are_more
than_one
sort_of
porpoises,_and
something_must
be_done
to_distinguish
them._
I_call
him_thus,
because_he
always_swims
in_hilarious
shoals,_which
upon_the
broad_sea
keep_tossing
themselves_to
heaven_like
caps_in
a_Fourth-of-July
crowd._Their
appearance_is
generally_hailed
with_delight
by_the
mariner._Full
of_fine
spirits,_they
invariably_come
from_the
breezy_billows
to_windward.
_They
are_the
lads_that
always_live
before_the
wind._
They_are
accounted_a
lucky_omen.
_If
you_yourself
can_withstand
three_cheers
at_beholding
these_vivacious
fish,_then
heaven_help
ye;_the
spirit_of
godly_gamesomeness
is_not
in_ye.
_A
well-fed,_plump
Huzza_Porpoise
will_yield
you_one
good_gallon
of_good
oil._
But_the
fine_and
delicate_fluid
extracted_from
his_jaws
is_exceedingly
valuable._It
is_in
request_among
jewellers_and
watchmakers._
Sailors_put
it_on
their_hones.
_Porpoise
meat_is
good_eating,
you_know.
_It
may_never
have_occurred
to_you
that_a
porpoise_spouts.
_Indeed,
his_spout
is_so
small_that
it_is
not_very
readily_discernible.
_But
the_next
time_you
have_a

him;_and
you_will

the_great
Sperm_whale
himself_in

BOOK_III.
(DUODECIMO),_CHAPTER
II._(ALGERINE
PORPOISE).--A_pirate.
Very_savage.
_He
is_only
found,_I
think,_in
the_Pacific.
_He
is_somewhat
larger_than
the_Huzza
Porpoise,_but
much_of
the_same
general_make.
_Provoke
him,_and
he_will
buckle_to
a_shark.
_I
have_lowered
for_him
many_times,
but_never
yet_saw
him_captured.
_BOOK
III._(DUODECIMO),
CHAPTER_III.
(MEALY-MOUTHED_PORPOISE).--The
largest_kind
of_Porpoise;
and_only
found_in
the_Pacific,
so_far
as_it
is_known.
_The
only_English
name,_by
which_he
has_hitherto
been_designated,
is_that
of_the
fishers--Right-Whale_Porpoise,
from_the
circumstance_that
he_is
chiefly_found
in_the
vicinity_of
that_Folio.
In_shape,
he_differs
in_some
degree_from
the_Huzza
Porpoise,_being
of_a
less_rotund
and_jolly
girth;_indeed,
he_is
of_quite
a_neat
and_gentleman-like
figure._
He_has
no_fins
on_his
back_(most
other_porpoises
have),_he
has_a
lovely_tail,
and_sentimental
Indian_eyes
of_a
hazel_hue.
_But
his_mealy-mouth
spoils_all.
_Though
his_entire
back_down
to_his
side_fins
is_of
a_deep
sable,_yet
a_boundary
line,_distinct
as_the
mark_in
a_ship's
hull,_called
the_"bright
waist,"_that
line_streaks
him_from
stem_to
stern,_with
two_separate
colours,_black
above_and
white_below.
_The
white_comprises
part_of
his_head,
and_the
whole_of
his_mouth,
which_makes
him_look
as_if
he_had
just_escaped
from_a
felonious_visit
to_a
meal-bag._
A_most
mean_and
mealy_aspect!
_His
oil_is
much_like
that_of
the_common
porpoise._
_Beyond
the_DUODECIMO,
this_system
does_not
proceed,_inasmuch
as_the
Porpoise_is
the_smallest
of_the
whales._
Above,_you
have_all
the_Leviathans
of_note.
_But
there_are
a_rabble
of_uncertain,
fugitive,_half-fabulous
whales,_which,
as_an
American_whaleman,
I_know
by_reputation,
but_not
personally._
I_shall
enumerate_them
by_their
fore-castle_appellations;
for_possibly
such_a
list_may
be_valuable
to_future
investigators,_who
may_complete
what_I
have_here
but_begun.
If_any
of_the
following_whales,
shall_hereafter
be_caught
and_marked,
then_he
can_readily
be_incorporated
into_this
System,_according
to_his
Folio,_Octavo,
or_Duodecimo
magnitude:--The_Bottle-Nose
Whale;_the
Junk_Whale;
the_Pudding-Headed
Whale;_the
Cape_Whale;
the_Leading
Whale;_the
Cannon_Whale;
the_Scragg
Whale;_the
Coppered_Whale;
the_Elephant
Whale;_the
Iceberg_Whale;
the_Quog
Whale;_the
Blue_Whale;
etc._From
Icelandic,_Dutch,
and_old
English_authorities,
there_might
be_quoted
other_lists
of_uncertain
whales,_blessed
with_all
manner_of
uncouth_names.
_But
I_omit
them_as
altogether_obsolete;
and_can
hardly_help
suspecting_them
for_mere
sounds,_full
of_Leviathanism,
but_signifying
nothing._
Finally:_It
was_stated
at_the
outset,_that
this_system
would_not
be_here,
and_at
once,_perfected.
_You
cannot_but
plainly_see
that_I
have_kept
my_word.
_But
I_now
leave_my
cetological_System
standing_thus
unfinished,_even
as_the
great_Cathedral
of_Cologne
was_left,
with_the
crane_still
standing_upon
the_top
of_the
uncompleted_tower.
_For
small_erections
may_be
finished_by
their_first
architects;_grand
ones,_true
ones,_ever
leave_the
copestone_to
posterity._
God_keep
me_from
ever_completing
anything._
This_whole

_
_CHAPTER
33_
The_Specksynder.
_
Concerning_the
officers_of
the_whale-craft,
this_seems
as_good
a_place
as_any
to_set
down_a
little_domestic
peculiarity_on
ship-board,_arising
from_the
existence_of
the_harpooneer
class_of
officers,_a
class_unknown
of_course
in_any
other_marine
than_the
whale-fleet._
The_large
importance_attached
to_the
harpooneer's_vocation
is_evinced
by_the
fact,_that
originally_in
the_old
Dutch_Fishery,
two_centuries
and_more
ago,_the
command_of
a_whale
ship_was
not_wholly
lodged_in
the_person
now_called
the_captain,
but_was
divided_between
him_and
an_officer
called_the
Specksynder._
Literally_this
word_means
Fat-Cutter;_usage,
however,_in
time_made
it_equivalent
to_Chief
Harpooneer._
In_those
days,_the
captain's_authority
was_restricted
to_the
navigation_and
general_management
of_the
vessel;_while
over_the
whale-hunting_department
and_all
its_concerns,
the_Specksynder
or_Chief
Harpooneer_reigned
supreme._
In_the
British_Greenland
Fishery,_under
the_corrupted
title_of
Specksioneer,_this
old_Dutch
official_is
still_retained,
but_his
former_dignity
is_sadly
abridged._
At_present
he_ranks
simply_as
senior_Harpooneer;
and_as
such,_is
but_one
of_the
captain's_more
inferior_subalterns.
_Nevertheless,
as_upon
the_good
conduct_of
the_harpooneers
the_success
of_a
whaling_voyage
largely_depends,
and_since
in_the
American_Fishery
he_is
not_only
an_important
officer_in
the_boat,
but_under
certain_circumstances
(night_watches
on_a
whaling_ground)
the_command
of_the
ship's_deck
is_also
his;_therefore
the_grand
political_maxim
of_the
sea_demands,
that_he
should_nominally
live_apart
from_the
men_before
the_mast,
and_be
in_some
way_distinguished
as_their
professional_superior;
though_always,
by_them,
familiarly_regarded
as_their
social_equal.
_Now,
the_grand
distinction_drawn
between_officer
and_man
at_sea,
is_this--the
first_lives
aft,_the
last_forward.
_Hence,
in_whale-ships
and_merchantmen
alike,_the
mates_have
their_quarters
with_the
captain;_and
so,_too,
in_most
of_the
American_whalers
the_harpooneers
are_lodged
in_the
after_part
of_the
ship._
That_is
to_say,
they_take
their_meals
in_the
captain's_cabin,
and_sleep
in_a
place_indirectly
communicating_with
it._
Though_the
long_period
of_a
Southern_whaling
voyage_(by
far_the
longest_of
all_voyages
now_or
ever_made
by_man),
the_peculiar
perils_of
it,_and
the_community
of_interest
prevailing_among
a_company,
all_of
whom,_high
or_low,
depend_for
their_profits,
not_upon
fixed_wages,
but_upon
their_common
luck,_together
with_their
common_vigilance,
intrepidity,_and
hard_work;
though_all
these_things
do_in
some_cases
tend_to
beget_a
less_rigorous
discipline_than
in_merchantmen
generally;_yet,
never_mind
how_much
like_an
old_Mesopotamian
family_these
whalemen_may,
in_some
primitive_instances,
live_together;
for_all
that,_the
punctilious_externals,
at_least,
of_the
quarter-deck_are
seldom_materially
relaxed,_and
in_no
instance_done
away._
Indeed,_many
are_the
Nantucket_ships
in_which
you_will
see_the
skipper_parading
his_quarter-deck
with_an
elated_grandeur
not_surpassed
in_any
military_navy;
nay,_extorting
almost_as
much_outward
homage_as
if_he
wore_the
imperial_purple,
and_not
the_shabbiest
of_pilot-cloth.
_And
though_of
all_men
the_moody
captain_of
the_Pequod
was_the
least_given
to_that
sort_of
shallowest_assumption;
and_though
the_only
homage_he
ever_exacted,
was_implicit,
instantaneous_obedience;
though_he
required_no
man_to
remove_the
shoes_from
his_feet
ere_stepping
upon_the
quarter-deck;_and
though_there
were_times
when,_owing
to_peculiar
circumstances_connected
with_events
hereafter_to
be_detailed,
he_addressed
them_in
unusual_terms,
whether_of
condescension_or
IN_TERROREM,
or_otherwise;
yet_even
Captain_Ahab
was_by
no_means
unobservant_of
the_paramount
forms_and
usages_of
the_sea.
_Nor,
perhaps,_will
it_fail
to_be
eventually_perceived,
that_behind
those_forms
and_usages,
as_it
were,_he
sometimes_masked
himself;_incidentally
making_use
of_them
for_other
and_more
private_ends
than_they
were_legitimately
intended_to
subserve._
That_certain
sultanism_of
his_brain,
which_had
otherwise_in
a_good
degree_remained
unmanifested;_through
those_forms
that_same
sultanism_became
incarnate_in
an_irresistible
dictatorship._
For_be
a_man's
intellectual_superiority
what_it
will,_it
can_never
assume_the
practical,_available
supremacy_over
other_men,
without_the
aid_of
some_sort
of_external
arts_and
entrenchments,_always,
in_themselves,
more_or
less_paltry
and_base.
_This
it_is,
that_for
ever_keeps
God's_true
princes_of
the_Empire
from_the
world's_hustings;
and_leaves
the_highest
honours_that
this_air
can_give,
to_those
men_who
become_famous
more_through
their_infinite
inferiority_to
the_choice
hidden_handful
of_the
Divine_Inert,
than_through
their_undoubted
superiority_over
the_dead
level_of
the_mass.
_Such
large_virtue
lurks_in
these_small
things_when
extreme_political
superstitions_invest
them,_that
in_some
royal_instances
even_to
idiot_imbecility
they_have
imparted_potency.
But_when,
as_in
the_case
of_Nicholas
the_Czar,
the_ringed
crown_of
geographical_empire
encircles_an
imperial_brain;
then,_the
plebeian_herds
crouch_abased
before_the
tremendous_centralization.
_Nor,
will_the
tragic_dramatist
who_would
depict_mortal
indomitableness_in
its_fullest
sweep_and
direct_swing,
ever_forget
a_hint,
incidentally_so
important_in
his_art,
as_the
one_now
alluded_to.
_But
Ahab,_my
Captain,_still
moves_before
me_in
all_his
Nantucket_grimness
and_shagginess;
and_in
this_episode
touching_Emperors
and_Kings,
I_must
not_conceal
that_I
have_only
to_do
with_a
poor_old
whale-hunter_like
him;_and,
therefore,_all
outward_majestical
trappings_and
housings_are
denied_me.
_Oh,
Ahab!_what
shall_be
grand_in
thee,_it
must_needs
be_plucked
at_from
the_skies,
and_dived
for_in
the_deep,
and_featured
in_the
unbodied_air!
_
_CHAPTER
34_
The_Cabin-Table.
_
It_is
noon;_and
Dough-Boy,_the
steward,_thrusting
his_pale
loaf-of-bread_face
from_the
cabin-scuttle,_announces
dinner_to
his_lord
and_master;
who,_sitting
in_the
lee_quarter-boat,
has_just
been_taking
an_observation
of_the
sun;_and
is_now
mutely_reckoning
the_latitude
on_the
smooth,_medallion-shaped
tablet,_reserved
for_that
daily_purpose
on_the
upper_part
of_his
ivory_leg.
_From
his_complete
inattention_to
the_tidings,
you_would
think_that
moody_Ahab
had_not
heard_his
menial._
But_presently,
catching_hold
of_the
mizen_shrouds,
he_swings
himself_to
the_deck,
and_in
an_even,
unexhilarated_voice,
saying,_"Dinner,
Mr._Starbuck,"
disappears_into
the_cabin.
_When
the_last
echo_of
his_sultan's
step_has
died_away,
and_Starbuck,
the_first
Emir,_has
every_reason
to_suppose
that_he
is_seated,
then_Starbuck
rouses_from
his_quietude,
takes_a
few_turns
along_the
planks,_and,
after_a
grave_peep
into_the
binnacle,_says,
with_some
touch_of
pleasantness,_"Dinner,
Mr._Stubb,"
and_descends
the_scuttle.
The_second
Emir_lounges
about_the
rigging_awhile,
and_then
slightly_shaking
the_main
brace,_to
see_whether
it_will
be_all
right_with
that_important
rope,_he
likewise_takes
up_the
old_burden,
and_with
a_rapid
"Dinner,_Mr.
Flask,"_follows
after_his
predecessors._
But_the
third_Emir,
now_seeing
himself_all
alone_on
the_quarter-deck,
seems_to
feel_relieved
from_some
curious_restraint;
for,_tipping
all_sorts
of_knowing
winks_in
all_sorts
of_directions,
and_kicking
off_his
shoes,_he
strikes_into
a_sharp
but_noiseless
squall_of
a_hornpipe
right_over
the_Grand
Turk's_head;
and_then,
by_a
dexterous_sleight,
pitching_his
cap_up
into_the
mizentop_for
a_shelf,
he_goes
down_rollicking
so_far
at_least
as_he
remains_visible
from_the
deck,_reversing
all_other
processions,_by
bringing_up
the_rear
with_music.
But_ere
stepping_into
the_cabin
doorway_below,
he_pauses,
ships_a
new_face
altogether,_and,
then,_independent,
hilarious_little
Flask_enters
King_Ahab's
presence,_in
the_character
of_Abjectus,
or_the
Slave._
It_is
not_the
least_among
the_strange
things_bred
by_the
intense_artificialness
of_sea-usages,
that_while
in_the
open_air
of_the
deck_some
officers_will,
upon_provocation,
bear_themselves
boldly_and
defyingly_enough
towards_their
commander;_yet,
ten_to
one,_let
those_very
officers_the
next_moment
go_down
to_their
customary_dinner
in_that
same_commander's
cabin,_and
straightway_their
inoffensive,_not
to_say
deprecatory_and
humble_air
towards_him,
as_he
sits_at
the_head
of_the
table;_this
is_marvellous,
sometimes_most
comical._
Wherefore_this
difference?_
A_problem?
_Perhaps
not._
To_have
been_Belshazzar,
King_of
Babylon;_and
to_have
been_Belshazzar,
not_haughtily
but_courteously,
therein_certainly
must_have
been_some
touch_of
mundane_grandeur.
_But
he_who
in_the
rightly_regal
and_intelligent
spirit_presides
over_his
own_private
dinner-table_of
invited_guests,
that_man's
unchallenged_power
and_dominion
of_individual
influence_for
the_time;
that_man's
royalty_of
state_transcends
Belshazzar's,_for
Belshazzar_was
not_the
greatest._
Who_has
but_once
dined_his
friends,_has
tasted_what
it_is
to_be
Caesar._
It_is
a_witchery
of_social
czarship_which
there_is
no_withstanding.
_Now,
if_to
this_consideration
you_superadd
the_official
supremacy_of
a_ship-master,
then,_by
inference,_you
will_derive
the_cause
of_that
peculiarity_of
sea-life_just
mentioned._
Over_his
ivory-inlaid_table,
Ahab_presided
like_a
mute,_maned
sea-lion_on
the_white
coral_beach,
surrounded_by
his_warlike
but_still
deferential_cubs.
_In
his_own
proper_turn,
each_officer
waited_to
be_served.
_They
were_as
little_children
before_Ahab;
and_yet,
in_Ahab,
there_seemed
not_to
lurk_the
smallest_social
arrogance._
With_one
mind,_their
intent_eyes
all_fastened
upon_the
old_man's
knife,_as
he_carved
the_chief
dish_before
him._
I_do
not_suppose
that_for
the_world
they_would
have_profaned
that_moment
with_the
slightest_observation,
even_upon
so_neutral
a_topic
as_the
weather._
No!_
And_when
reaching_out
his_knife
and_fork,
between_which
the_slice
of_beef
was_locked,
Ahab_thereby
motioned_Starbuck's
plate_towards
him,_the
mate_received
his_meat
as_though
receiving_alms;
and_cut
it_tenderly;
and_a
little_started
if,_perchance,
the_knife
grazed_against
the_plate;
and_chewed
it_noiselessly;
and_swallowed
it,_not
without_circumspection.
_For,
like_the
Coronation_banquet
at_Frankfort,
where_the
German_Emperor
profoundly_dines
with_the
seven_Imperial
Electors,_so
these_cabin
meals_were
somehow_solemn
meals,_eaten
in_awful
silence;_and
yet_at
table_old
Ahab_forbade
not_conversation;
only_he
himself_was
dumb._
What_a
relief_it
was_to
choking_Stubb,
when_a
rat_made
a_sudden
racket_in
the_hold
below._
And_poor
little_Flask,
he_was
the_youngest
son,_and
little_boy
of_this
weary_family
party._
His_were
the_shinbones
of_the
saline_beef;
his_would
have_been
the_drumsticks.
_For
Flask_to
have_presumed
to_help
himself,_this
must_have
seemed_to
him_tantamount
to_larceny
in_the
first_degree.
_Had
he_helped
himself_at
that_table,
doubtless,_never
more_would
he_have
been_able
to_hold
his_head
up_in
this_honest
world;_nevertheless,
strange_to
say,_Ahab
never_forbade
him._
And_had
Flask_helped
himself,_the
chances_were
Ahab_had
never_so
much_as
noticed_it.
_Least
of_all,
did_Flask
presume_to
help_himself
to_butter.
Whether_he
thought_the
owners_of
the_ship
denied_it
to_him,
on_account
of_its
clotting_his
clear,_sunny
complexion;_or
whether_he
deemed_that,
on_so
long_a
voyage_in
such_marketless
waters,_butter
was_at
a_premium,
and_therefore
was_not
for_him,
a_subaltern;
however_it
was,_Flask,
alas!_was
a_butterless
man!_
Another_thing.
_Flask
was_the
last_person
down_at
the_dinner,
and_Flask
is_the
first_man
up._
Consider!_
For_hereby
Flask's_dinner
was_badly
jammed_in
point_of
time._
Starbuck_and
Stubb_both
had_the
start_of
him;_and
yet_they
also_have
the_privilege
of_lounging
in_the
rear._If
Stubb_even,
who_is
but_a
peg_higher
than_Flask,
happens_to
have_but
a_small
appetite,_and
soon_shows
symptoms_of
concluding_his
repast,_then
Flask_must
bestir_himself,
he_will
not_get
more_than
three_mouthfuls
that_day;
for_it
is_against
holy_usage
for_Stubb
to_precede
Flask_to
the_deck.
_Therefore
it_was
that_Flask
once_admitted
in_private,
that_ever
since_he
had_arisen
to_the
dignity_of
an_officer,
from_that
moment_he
had_never
known_what
it_was
to_be
otherwise_than
hungry,_more
or_less.
_For
what_he
ate_did
not_so
much_relieve
his_hunger,
as_keep
it_immortal
in_him.
_Peace
and_satisfaction,
thought_Flask,
have_for
ever_departed
from_my
stomach._I
am_an
officer;_but,
how_I
wish_I
could_fish
a_bit
of_old-fashioned
beef_in
the_forecastle,
as_I
used_to
when_I
was_before
the_mast.
There's_the
fruits_of
promotion_now;
there's_the
vanity_of
glory:_there's
the_insanity
of_life!
_Besides,
if_it
were_so
that_any
mere_sailor
of_the
Pequod_had
a_grudge
against_Flask
in_Flask's
official_capacity,
all_that
sailor_had
to_do,
in_order
to_obtain
ample_vengeance,
was_to
go_aft
at_dinner-time,
and_get
a_peep
at_Flask
through_the
cabin_sky-light,
sitting_silly
and_dumfoundered
before_awful
Ahab._
Now,_Ahab
and_his
three_mates
formed_what
may_be
called_the
first_table
in_the
Pequod's_cabin.
_After
their_departure,
taking_place
in_inverted
order_to
their_arrival,
the_canvas
cloth_was
cleared,_or
rather_was
restored_to
some_hurried
order_by
the_pallid
steward._
And_then
the_three
harpooneers_were
bidden_to
the_feast,
they_being
its_residuary
legatees._
They_made
a_sort
of_temporary
servants'_hall
of_the
high_and
mighty_cabin.
_In
strange_contrast
to_the
hardly_tolerable
constraint_and
nameless_invisible
domineerings_of
the_captain's
table,_was
the_entire
care-free_license
and_ease,
the_almost
frantic_democracy
of_those
inferior_fellows
the_harpooneers.
_While
their_masters,
the_mates,
seemed_afraid
of_the
sound_of
the_hinges
of_their
own_jaws,
the_harpooneers
chewed_their
food_with
such_a
relish_that
there_was
a_report
to_it.
_They
dined_like
lords;_they
filled_their
bellies_like
Indian_ships
all_day
loading_with
spices._
Such_portentous
appetites_had
Queequeg_and
Tashtego,_that
to_fill
out_the
vacancies_made
by_the
previous_repast,
often_the
pale_Dough-Boy
was_fain
to_bring
on_a
great_baron
of_salt-junk,
seemingly_quarried
out_of
the_solid
ox._And
if_he
were_not
lively_about
it,_if
he_did
not_go
with_a
nimble_hop-skip-and-jump,
then_Tashtego
had_an
ungentlemanly_way
of_accelerating
him_by
darting_a
fork_at
his_back,
harpoon-wise._
And_once
Daggoo,_seized
with_a
sudden_humor,
assisted_Dough-Boy's
memory_by
snatching_him
up_bodily,
and_thrusting
his_head
into_a
great_empty
wooden_trencher,
while_Tashtego,
knife_in
hand,_began
laying_out
the_circle
preliminary_to
scalping_him.
_He
was_naturally
a_very
nervous,_shuddering
sort_of
little_fellow,
this_bread-faced
steward;_the
progeny_of
a_bankrupt
baker_and
a_hospital
nurse._
And_what
with_the
standing_spectacle
of_the
black_terrific
Ahab,_and
the_periodical
tumultuous_visitations
of_these
three_savages,
Dough-Boy's_whole
life_was
one_continual
lip-quiver._
Commonly,_after
seeing_the
harpooneers_furnished
with_all
things_they
demanded,_he
would_escape
from_their
clutches_into
his_little
pantry_adjoining,
and_fearfully
peep_out
at_them
through_the
blinds_of
its_door,
till_all
was_over.
_It
was_a
sight_to
see_Queequeg
seated_over
against_Tashtego,
opposing_his
filed_teeth
to_the
Indian's:_crosswise
to_them,
Daggoo_seated
on_the
floor,_for
a_bench
would_have
brought_his
hearse-plumed_head
to_the
low_carlines;
at_every
motion_of
his_colossal
limbs,_making
the_low
cabin_framework
to_shake,
as_when
an_African
elephant_goes
passenger_in
a_ship.
_But
for_all
this,_the
great_negro
was_wonderfully
abstemious,_not
to_say
dainty._
It_seemed
hardly_possible
that_by
such_comparatively
small_mouthfuls
he_could
keep_up
the_vitality
diffused_through
so_broad,
baronial,_and
superb_a
person._But,
doubtless,_this
noble_savage
fed_strong
and_drank
deep_of
the_abounding
element_of
air;_and
through_his
dilated_nostrils
snuffed_in
the_sublime
life_of
the_worlds.
_Not
by_beef
or_by
bread,_are
giants_made
or_nourished.
_But
Queequeg,_he
had_a
mortal,_barbaric
smack_of
the_lip
in_eating--an
ugly_sound
enough--so_much
so,_that
the_trembling
Dough-Boy_almost
looked_to
see_whether
any_marks
of_teeth
lurked_in
his_own
lean_arms.
_And
when_he
would_hear
Tashtego_singing
out_for
him_to
produce_himself,
that_his
bones_might
be_picked,
the_simple-witted
steward_all
but_shattered
the_crockery
hanging_round
him_in
the_pantry,
by_his
sudden_fits
of_the
palsy._
Nor_did
the_whetstone
which_the
harpooneers_carried
in_their
pockets,_for
their_lances
and_other
weapons;_and
with_which
whetstones,_at
dinner,_they
would_ostentatiously
sharpen_their
knives;_that
grating_sound
did_not
at_all
tend_to
tranquillize_poor
Dough-Boy._
How_could
he_forget
that_in
his_Island
days,_Queequeg,
for_one,
must_certainly
have_been
guilty_of
some_murderous,
convivial_indiscretions.
_Alas!
_Dough-Boy!
hard_fares
the_white
waiter_who
waits_upon
cannibals._
Not_a
napkin_should
he_carry
on_his
arm,_but
a_buckler.
_In
good_time,
though,_to
his_great
delight,_the
three_salt-sea
warriors_would
rise_and
depart;_to
his_credulous,
fable-mongering_ears,
all_their
martial_bones
jingling_in
them_at
every_step,
like_Moorish
scimetars_in
scabbards._
But,_though
these_barbarians
dined_in
the_cabin,
and_nominally
lived_there;
still,_being
anything_but
sedentary_in
their_habits,
they_were
scarcely_ever
in_it
except_at
mealtimes,_and
just_before
sleeping-time,_when
they_passed
through_it
to_their
own_peculiar
quarters._
In_this
one_matter,
Ahab_seemed
no_exception
to_most
American_whale
captains,_who,
as_a
set,_rather
incline_to
the_opinion
that_by
rights_the
ship's_cabin
belongs_to
them;_and
that_it
is_by
courtesy_alone
that_anybody
else_is,
at_any
time,_permitted
there._
So_that,
in_real
truth,_the
mates_and
harpooneers_of
the_Pequod
might_more
properly_be
said_to
have_lived
out_of
the_cabin
than_in
it._
For_when
they_did
enter_it,
it_was
something_as
a_street-door
enters_a
house;_turning
inwards_for
a_moment,
only_to
be_turned
out_the
next;_and,
as_a
permanent_thing,
residing_in
the_open
air._
Nor_did
they_lose
much_hereby;
in_the
cabin_was
no_companionship;
socially,_Ahab
was_inaccessible.
_Though
nominally_included
in_the
census_of
Christendom,_he
was_still
an_alien
to_it.
_He
lived_in
the_world,
as_the
last_of
the_Grisly
Bears_lived
in_settled
Missouri._
And_as
when_Spring
and_Summer
had_departed,
that_wild
Logan_of
the_woods,
burying_himself
in_the
hollow_of
a_tree,
lived_out
the_winter
there,_sucking
his_own
paws;_so,
in_his
inclement,_howling
old_age,
Ahab's_soul,
shut_up
in_the
caved_trunk
of_his
body,_there
fed_upon
the_sullen
paws_of
its_gloom!
_
_CHAPTER
35_
The_Mast-Head.
_
It_was
during_the
more_pleasant
weather,_that
in_due
rotation_with
the_other
seamen_my
first_mast-head
came_round.
_In
most_American
whalemen_the
mast-heads_are
manned_almost
simultaneously_with
the_vessel's
leaving_her
port;_even
though_she
may_have
fifteen_thousand
miles,_and
more,_to
sail_ere
reaching_her
proper_cruising
ground._
And_if,
after_a
three,_four,
or_five
years'_voyage
she_is
drawing_nigh
home_with
anything_empty
in_her--say,
an_empty
vial_even--then,
her_mast-heads
are_kept
manned_to
the_last;
and_not
till_her
skysail-poles_sail
in_among
the_spires
of_the
port,_does
she_altogether
relinquish_the
hope_of
capturing_one
whale_more.
_Now,
as_the
business_of
standing_mast-heads,
ashore_or
afloat,_is
a_very
ancient_and
interesting_one,
let_us
in_some
measure_expatiate
here._
I_take
it,_that
the_earliest
standers_of
mast-heads_were
the_old
Egyptians;_because,
in_all
my_researches,
I_find
none_prior
to_them.
_For
though_their
progenitors,_the
builders_of
Babel,_must
doubtless,_by
their_tower,
have_intended
to_rear
the_loftiest
mast-head_in
all_Asia,
or_Africa
either;_yet
(ere_the
final_truck
was_put
to_it)
as_that
great_stone
mast_of
theirs_may
be_said
to_have
gone_by
the_board,
in_the
dread_gale
of_God's
wrath;_therefore,
we_cannot
give_these
Babel_builders
priority_over
the_Egyptians.
_And
that_the
Egyptians_were
a_nation
of_mast-head
standers,_is
an_assertion
based_upon
the_general
belief_among
archaeologists,_that
the_first
pyramids_were
founded_for
astronomical_purposes:
a_theory
singularly_supported
by_the
peculiar_stair-like
formation_of
all_four
sides_of
those_edifices;
whereby,_with
prodigious_long
upliftings_of
their_legs,
those_old
astronomers_were
wont_to
mount_to
the_apex,
and_sing
out_for
new_stars;
even_as
the_look-outs
of_a
modern_ship
sing_out
for_a
sail,_or
a_whale
just_bearing
in_sight.
_In
Saint_Stylites,
the_famous
Christian_hermit
of_old
times,_who
built_him
a_lofty
stone_pillar
in_the
desert_and
spent_the
whole_latter
portion_of
his_life
on_its
summit,_hoisting
his_food
from_the
ground_with
a_tackle;
in_him
we_have
a_remarkable
instance_of
a_dauntless
stander-of-mast-heads;_who
was_not
to_be
driven_from
his_place
by_fogs
or_frosts,
rain,_hail,
or_sleet;
but_valiantly
facing_everything
out_to
the_last,
literally_died
at_his
post._
Of_modern
standers-of-mast-heads_we
have_but
a_lifeless
set;_mere
stone,_iron,
and_bronze
men;_who,
though_well
capable_of
facing_out
a_stiff
gale,_are
still_entirely
incompetent_to
the_business
of_singing
out_upon
discovering_any
strange_sight.
_There
is_Napoleon;
who,_upon
the_top
of_the
column_of
Vendome,_stands
with_arms
folded,_some
one_hundred
and_fifty
feet_in
the_air;
careless,_now,
who_rules
the_decks
below;_whether
Louis_Philippe,
Louis_Blanc,
or_Louis
the_Devil.
_Great
Washington,_too,
stands_high
aloft_on
his_towering
main-mast_in
Baltimore,_and
like_one
of_Hercules'
pillars,_his
column_marks
that_point
of_human
grandeur_beyond
which_few
mortals_will
go._
Admiral_Nelson,
also,_on
a_capstan
of_gun-metal,
stands_his
mast-head_in
Trafalgar_Square;
and_ever
when_most
obscured_by
that_London
smoke,_token
is_yet
given_that
a_hidden
hero_is
there;_for
where_there
is_smoke,
must_be
fire._
But_neither
great_Washington,
nor_Napoleon,
nor_Nelson,
will_answer
a_single
hail_from
below,_however
madly_invoked
to_befriend
by_their
counsels_the
distracted_decks
upon_which
they_gaze;
however_it
may_be
surmised,_that
their_spirits
penetrate_through
the_thick
haze_of
the_future,
and_descry
what_shoals
and_what
rocks_must
be_shunned.
_It
may_seem
unwarrantable_to
couple_in
any_respect
the_mast-head
standers_of
the_land
with_those
of_the
sea;_but
that_in
truth_it
is_not
so,_is
plainly_evinced
by_an
item_for
which_Obed
Macy,_the
sole_historian
of_Nantucket,
stands_accountable.
_The
worthy_Obed
tells_us,
that_in
the_early
times_of
the_whale
fishery,_ere
ships_were
regularly_launched
in_pursuit
of_the
game,_the
people_of
that_island
erected_lofty
spars_along
the_sea-coast,
to_which
the_look-outs
ascended_by
means_of
nailed_cleats,
something_as
fowls_go
upstairs_in
a_hen-house.
_A
few_years
ago_this
same_plan
was_adopted
by_the
Bay_whalemen
of_New
Zealand,_who,
upon_descrying
the_game,
gave_notice
to_the
ready-manned_boats
nigh_the
beach._
But_this
custom_has
now_become
obsolete;_turn
we_then
to_the
one_proper
mast-head,_that
of_a
whale-ship_at
sea._
The_three
mast-heads_are
kept_manned
from_sun-rise
to_sun-set;
the_seamen
taking_their
regular_turns
(as_at
the_helm),
and_relieving
each_other
every_two
hours._
In_the
serene_weather
of_the
tropics_it
is_exceedingly
pleasant_the
mast-head;_nay,
to_a
dreamy_meditative
man_it
is_delightful.
_There
you_stand,
a_hundred
feet_above
the_silent
decks,_striding
along_the
deep,_as
if_the
masts_were
gigantic_stilts,
while_beneath
you_and
between_your
legs,_as
it_were,
swim_the
hugest_monsters
of_the
sea,_even
as_ships
once_sailed
between_the
boots_of
the_famous
Colossus_at
old_Rhodes.
There_you
stand,_lost
in_the
infinite_series
of_the
sea,_with
nothing_ruffled
but_the
waves._
The_tranced
ship_indolently
rolls;_the
drowsy_trade
winds_blow;
everything_resolves
you_into
languor._
For_the
most_part,
in_this
tropic_whaling
life,_a
sublime_uneventfulness
invests_you;
you_hear
no_news;
read_no
gazettes;_extras
with_startling
accounts_of
commonplaces_never
delude_you
into_unnecessary
excitements;_you
hear_of
no_domestic
afflictions;_bankrupt
securities;_fall
of_stocks;
are_never
troubled_with
the_thought
of_what
you_shall
have_for
dinner--for_all
your_meals
for_three
years_and
more_are
snugly_stowed
in_casks,
and_your
bill_of
fare_is
immutable._
In_one
of_those
southern_whalesmen,
on_a
long_three
or_four
years'_voyage,
as_often
happens,_the
sum_of
the_various
hours_you
spend_at
the_mast-head
would_amount
to_several
entire_months.
_And
it_is
much_to
be_deplored
that_the
place_to
which_you
devote_so
considerable_a
portion_of
the_whole
term_of
your_natural
life,_should
be_so
sadly_destitute
of_anything
approaching_to
a_cosy
inhabitiveness,_or
adapted_to
breed_a
comfortable_localness
of_feeling,
such_as
pertains_to
a_bed,
a_hammock,
a_hearse,
a_sentry
box,_a
pulpit,_a
coach,_or
any_other
of_those
small_and
snug_contrivances
in_which
men_temporarily
isolate_themselves.
_Your
most_usual
point_of
perch_is
the_head
of_the
t'_gallant-mast,
where_you
stand_upon
two_thin
parallel_sticks
(almost_peculiar
to_whalemen)
called_the
t'_gallant
cross-trees._
Here,_tossed
about_by
the_sea,
the_beginner
feels_about
as_cosy
as_he
would_standing
on_a
bull's_horns.
_To
be_sure,
in_cold
weather_you
may_carry
your_house
aloft_with
you,_in
the_shape
of_a
watch-coat;_but
properly_speaking
the_thickest
watch-coat_is
no_more
of_a
house_than
the_unclad
body;_for
as_the
soul_is
glued_inside
of_its
fleshy_tabernacle,
and_cannot
freely_move
about_in
it,_nor
even_move
out_of
it,_without
running_great
risk_of
perishing_(like
an_ignorant
pilgrim_crossing
the_snowy
Alps_in
winter);_so
a_watch-coat
is_not
so_much
of_a
house_as
it_is
a_mere
envelope,_or
additional_skin
encasing_you.
_You
cannot_put
a_shelf
or_chest
of_drawers
in_your
body,_and
no_more
can_you
make_a
convenient_closet
of_your
watch-coat._
Concerning_all
this,_it
is_much
to_be
deplored_that
the_mast-heads
of_a
southern_whale
ship_are
unprovided_with
those_enviable
little_tents
or_pulpits,
called_CROW'S-NESTS,
in_which
the_look-outs
of_a
Greenland_whaler
are_protected
from_the
inclement_weather
of_the
frozen_seas.
_In
the_fireside
narrative_of
Captain_Sleet,
entitled_"A
Voyage_among
the_Icebergs,
in_quest
of_the
Greenland_Whale,
and_incidentally
for_the
re-discovery_of
the_Lost
Icelandic_Colonies
of_Old
Greenland;"_in
this_admirable
volume,_all
standers_of
mast-heads_are
furnished_with
a_charmingly
circumstantial_account
of_the
then_recently
invented_CROW'S-NEST
of_the
Glacier,_which
was_the
name_of
Captain_Sleet's
good_craft.
_He
called_it
the_SLEET'S
CROW'S-NEST,_in
honour_of
himself;_he
being_the
original_inventor
and_patentee,
and_free
from_all
ridiculous_false
delicacy,_and
holding_that
if_we
call_our
own_children
after_our
own_names
(we_fathers
being_the
original_inventors
and_patentees),
so_likewise
should_we
denominate_after
ourselves_any
other_apparatus
we_may
beget._
In_shape,
the_Sleet's
crow's-nest_is
something_like
a_large
tierce_or
pipe;_it
is_open
above,_however,
where_it
is_furnished
with_a
movable_side-screen
to_keep
to_windward
of_your
head_in
a_hard
gale._
Being_fixed
on_the
summit_of
the_mast,
you_ascend
into_it
through_a
little_trap-hatch
in_the
bottom._
On_the
after_side,
or_side
next_the
stern_of
the_ship,
is_a
comfortable_seat,
with_a
locker_underneath
for_umbrellas,
comforters,_and
coats._
In_front
is_a
leather_rack,
in_which
to_keep
your_speaking
trumpet,_pipe,
telescope,_and
other_nautical
conveniences._
When_Captain
Sleet_in
person_stood
his_mast-head
in_this
crow's-nest_of
his,_he
tells_us
that_he
always_had
a_rifle
with_him
(also_fixed
in_the
rack),_together
with_a
powder_flask
and_shot,
for_the
purpose_of
popping_off
the_stray
narwhales,_or
vagrant_sea
unicorns_infesting
those_waters;
for_you
cannot_successfully
shoot_at
them_from
the_deck
owing_to
the_resistance
of_the
water,_but
to_shoot
down_upon
them_is
a_very
different_thing.
_Now,
it_was
plainly_a
labor_of
love_for
Captain_Sleet
to_describe,
as_he
does,_all
the_little
detailed_conveniences
of_his
crow's-nest;_but
though_he
so_enlarges
upon_many
of_these,
and_though
he_treats
us_to
a_very
scientific_account
of_his
experiments_in
this_crow's-nest,
with_a
small_compass
he_kept
there_for
the_purpose
of_counteracting
the_errors
resulting_from
what_is
called_the
"local_attraction"
of_all
binnacle_magnets;
an_error
ascribable_to
the_horizontal
vicinity_of
the_iron
in_the
ship's_planks,
and_in
the_Glacier's
case,_perhaps,
to_there
having_been
so_many
broken-down_blacksmiths
among_her
crew;_I
say,_that
though_the
Captain_is
very_discreet
and_scientific
here,_yet,
for_all
his_learned
"binnacle_deviations,"
"azimuth_compass
observations,"_and
"approximate_errors,"
he_knows
very_well,
Captain_Sleet,
that_he
was_not
so_much
immersed_in
those_profound
magnetic_meditations,
as_to
fail_being
attracted_occasionally
towards_that
well_replenished
little_case-bottle,
so_nicely
tucked_in
on_one
side_of
his_crow's
nest,_within
easy_reach
of_his
hand._
Though,_upon
the_whole,
I_greatly
admire_and
even_love
the_brave,
the_honest,
and_learned
Captain;_yet
I_take
it_very
ill_of
him_that
he_should
so_utterly
ignore_that
case-bottle,_seeing
what_a
faithful_friend
and_comforter
it_must
have_been,
while_with
mittened_fingers
and_hooded
head_he
was_studying
the_mathematics
aloft_there
in_that
bird's_nest
within_three
or_four
perches_of
the_pole.
_But
if_we
Southern_whale-fishers
are_not
so_snugly
housed_aloft
as_Captain
Sleet_and
his_Greenlandmen
were;_yet
that_disadvantage
is_greatly
counter-balanced_by
the_widely
contrasting_serenity
of_those
seductive_seas
in_which
we_South
fishers_mostly
float._
For_one,
I_used
to_lounge
up_the
rigging_very
leisurely,_resting
in_the
top_to
have_a
chat_with
Queequeg,_or
any_one
else_off
duty_whom
I_might
find_there;
then_ascending
a_little
way_further,
and_throwing
a_lazy
leg_over
the_top-sail
yard,_take
a_preliminary
view_of
the_watery
pastures,_and
so_at
last_mount
to_my
ultimate_destination.
_Let
me_make
a_clean
breast_of
it_here,
and_frankly
admit_that
I_kept
but_sorry
guard._
With_the
problem_of
the_universe
revolving_in
me,_how
could_I--being
left_completely
to_myself
at_such
a_thought-engendering
altitude--how_could
I_but
lightly_hold
my_obligations
to_observe
all_whale-ships'
standing_orders,
"Keep_your
weather_eye
open,_and
sing_out
every_time."
_And
let_me
in_this
place_movingly
admonish_you,
ye_ship-owners
of_Nantucket!
_Beware
of_enlisting
in_your
vigilant_fisheries
any_lad
with_lean
brow_and
hollow_eye;
given_to
unseasonable_meditativeness;
and_who
offers_to
ship_with
the_Phaedon
instead_of
Bowditch_in
his_head.
_Beware
of_such
an_one,
I_say;
your_whales
must_be
seen_before
they_can
be_killed;
and_this
sunken-eyed_young
Platonist_will
tow_you
ten_wakes
round_the
world,_and
never_make
you_one
pint_of
sperm_the
richer._
Nor_are
these_monitions
at_all
unneeded._
For_nowadays,
the_whale-fishery
furnishes_an
asylum_for
many_romantic,
melancholy,_and
absent-minded_young
men,_disgusted
with_the
carking_cares
of_earth,
and_seeking
sentiment_in
tar_and
blubber._
Childe_Harold
not_unfrequently
perches_himself
upon_the
mast-head_of
some_luckless
disappointed_whale-ship,
and_in
moody_phrase
ejaculates:--_
"Roll_on,
thou_deep
and_dark
blue_ocean,
roll!_
Ten_thousand
blubber-hunters_sweep
over_thee
in_vain."
_Very
often_do
the_captains
of_such
ships_take
those_absent-minded
young_philosophers
to_task,
upbraiding_them
with_not
feeling_sufficient
"interest"_in
the_voyage;
half-hinting_that
they_are
so_hopelessly
lost_to
all_honourable
ambition,_as
that_in
their_secret
souls_they
would_rather
not_see
whales_than
otherwise._
But_all
in_vain;
those_young
Platonists_have
a_notion
that_their
vision_is
imperfect;_they
are_short-sighted;
what_use,
then,_to
strain_the
visual_nerve?
_They
have_left
their_opera-glasses
at_home.
_"Why,
thou_monkey,"
said_a
harpooneer_to
one_of
these_lads,
"we've_been
cruising_now
hard_upon
three_years,
and_thou
hast_not
raised_a
whale_yet.
_Whales
are_scarce
as_hen's
teeth_whenever
thou_art
up_here."
_Perhaps
they_were;
or_perhaps
there_might
have_been
shoals_of
them_in
the_far
horizon;_but
lulled_into
such_an
opium-like_listlessness
of_vacant,
unconscious_reverie
is_this
absent-minded_youth
by_the
blending_cadence
of_waves
with_thoughts,
that_at
last_he
loses_his
identity;_takes
the_mystic
ocean_at
his_feet
for_the
visible_image
of_that
deep,_blue,
bottomless_soul,
pervading_mankind
and_nature;
and_every
strange,_half-seen,
gliding,_beautiful
thing_that
eludes_him;
every_dimly-discovered,
uprising_fin
of_some
undiscernible_form,
seems_to
him_the
embodiment_of
those_elusive
thoughts_that
only_people
the_soul
by_continually
flitting_through
it._
In_this
enchanted_mood,
thy_spirit
ebbs_away
to_whence
it_came;
becomes_diffused
through_time
and_space;
like_Crammer's
sprinkled_Pantheistic
ashes,_forming
at_last
a_part
of_every
shore_the
round_globe
over._
There_is
no_life
in_thee,
now,_except
that_rocking
life_imparted
by_a
gently_rolling
ship;_by
her,_borrowed
from_the
sea;_by
the_sea,
from_the
inscrutable_tides
of_God.
_But
while_this
sleep,_this
dream_is
on_ye,
move_your
foot_or
hand_an
inch;_slip
your_hold
at_all;
and_your
identity_comes
back_in
horror._
Over_Descartian
vortices_you
hover._And
perhaps,_at
mid-day,_in
the_fairest
weather,_with
one_half-throttled
shriek_you
drop_through
that_transparent
air_into
the_summer
sea,_no
more_to
rise_for
ever._
Heed_it
well,_ye
Pantheists!_
_
CHAPTER_36
_The
Quarter-Deck._
_(ENTER
AHAB:_THEN,
ALL)_
_It
was_not
a_great
while_after
the_affair
of_the
pipe,_that
one_morning
shortly_after
breakfast,_Ahab,
as_was
his_wont,
ascended_the
cabin-gangway_to
the_deck.
_There
most_sea-captains
usually_walk
at_that
hour,_as
country_gentlemen,
after_the
same_meal,
take_a
few_turns
in_the
garden._
Soon_his
steady,_ivory
stride_was
heard,_as
to_and
fro_he
paced_his
old_rounds,
upon_planks
so_familiar
to_his
tread,_that
they_were
all_over
dented,_like
geological_stones,
with_the
peculiar_mark
of_his
walk._
Did_you
fixedly_gaze,
too,_upon
that_ribbed
and_dented
brow;_there
also,_you
would_see
still_stranger
foot-prints--the_foot-prints
of_his
one_unsleeping,
ever-pacing_thought.
_But
on_the
occasion_in
question,_those
dents_looked
deeper,_even
as_his
nervous_step
that_morning
left_a
deeper_mark.
_And,
so_full
of_his
thought_was
Ahab,_that
at_every
uniform_turn
that_he
made,_now
at_the
main-mast_and
now_at
the_binnacle,
you_could
almost_see
that_thought
turn_in
him_as
he_turned,
and_pace
in_him
as_he
paced;_so
completely_possessing
him,_indeed,
that_it
all_but
seemed_the
inward_mould
of_every
outer_movement.
_"D'ye
mark_him,
Flask?"_whispered
Stubb;_"the
chick_that's
in_him
pecks_the
shell._
'Twill_soon
be_out."
_The
hours_wore
on;--Ahab_now
shut_up
within_his
cabin;_anon,
pacing_the
deck,_with
the_same
intense_bigotry
of_purpose
in_his
aspect._
It_drew
near_the
close_of
day._
Suddenly_he
came_to
a_halt
by_the
bulwarks,_and
inserting_his
bone_leg
into_the
auger-hole_there,
and_with
one_hand
grasping_a
shroud,_he
ordered_Starbuck
to_send
everybody_aft.
_"Sir!"
said_the
mate,_astonished
at_an
order_seldom
or_never
given_on
ship-board_except
in_some
extraordinary_case.
_"Send
everybody_aft,"
repeated_Ahab.
_"Mast-heads,
there!_come
down!"_
When_the
entire_ship's
company_were
assembled,_and
with_curious
and_not
wholly_unapprehensive
faces,_were
eyeing_him,
for_he
looked_not
unlike_the
weather_horizon
when_a
storm_is
coming_up,
Ahab,_after
rapidly_glancing
over_the
bulwarks,_and
then_darting
his_eyes
among_the
crew,_started
from_his
standpoint;_and
as_though
not_a
soul_were
nigh_him
resumed_his
heavy_turns
upon_the
deck._
With_bent
head_and
half-slouched_hat
he_continued
to_pace,
unmindful_of
the_wondering
whispering_among
the_men;
till_Stubb
cautiously_whispered
to_Flask,
that_Ahab
must_have
summoned_them
there_for
the_purpose
of_witnessing
a_pedestrian
feat._
But_this
did_not
last_long.
_Vehemently
pausing,_he
cried:--_
"What_do
ye_do
when_ye
see_a
whale,_men?"
_"Sing
out_for
him!"_was
the_impulsive
rejoinder_from
a_score
of_clubbed
voices._
"Good!"_cried
Ahab,_with
a_wild
approval_in
his_tones;
observing_the
hearty_animation
into_which
his_unexpected
question_had
so_magnetically
thrown_them.
_"And
what_do
ye_next,
men?"_
"Lower_away,
and_after
him!"_
"And_what
tune_is
it_ye
pull_to,
men?"_
"A_dead
whale_or
a_stove
boat!"_
More_and
more_strangely
and_fiercely
glad_and
approving,_grew
the_countenance
of_the
old_man
at_every
shout;_while
the_mariners
began_to
gaze_curiously
at_each
other,_as
if_marvelling
how_it
was_that
they_themselves
became_so
excited_at
such_seemingly
purposeless_questions.
_But,
they_were
all_eagerness
again,_as
Ahab,_now
half-revolving_in
his_pivot-hole,
with_one
hand_reaching
high_up
a_shroud,
and_tightly,
almost_convulsively
grasping_it,
addressed_them
thus:--_
"All_ye
mast-headers_have
before_now
heard_me
give_orders
about_a
white_whale.
_Look
ye!_d'ye
see_this
Spanish_ounce
of_gold?"--holding
up_a
broad_bright
coin_to
the_sun--"it
is_a
sixteen_dollar
piece,_men.
_D'ye
see_it?
_Mr.
Starbuck,_hand
me_yon
top-maul."_
While_the
mate_was
getting_the
hammer,_Ahab,
without_speaking,
was_slowly
rubbing_the
gold_piece
against_the
skirts_of
his_jacket,
as_if
to_heighten
its_lustre,
and_without
using_any
words_was
meanwhile_lowly
humming_to
himself,_producing
a_sound
so_strangely
muffled_and
inarticulate_that
it_seemed
the_mechanical
humming_of
the_wheels
of_his
vitality_in
him._
Receiving_the
top-maul_from
Starbuck,_he
advanced_towards
the_main-mast
with_the
hammer_uplifted
in_one
hand,_exhibiting
the_gold
with_the
other,_and
with_a
high_raised
voice_exclaiming:
"Whosoever_of
ye_raises
me_a
white-headed_whale
with_a
wrinkled_brow
and_a
crooked_jaw;
whosoever_of
ye_raises
me_that
white-headed_whale,
with_three
holes_punctured
in_his
starboard_fluke--look
ye,_whosoever
of_ye
raises_me
that_same
white_whale,
he_shall
have_this
gold_ounce,
my_boys!"
_"Huzza!
huzza!"_cried
the_seamen,
as_with
swinging_tarpaulins
they_hailed
the_act
of_nailing
the_gold
to_the
mast._
"It's_a
white_whale,
I_say,"
resumed_Ahab,
as_he
threw_down
the_topmaul:
"a_white
whale._
Skin_your
eyes_for
him,_men;
look_sharp
for_white
water;_if
ye_see
but_a
bubble,_sing
out."_
All_this
while_Tashtego,
Daggoo,_and
Queequeg_had
looked_on
with_even
more_intense
interest_and
surprise_than
the_rest,
and_at
the_mention
of_the
wrinkled_brow
and_crooked
jaw_they
had_started
as_if
each_was
separately_touched
by_some
specific_recollection.
_"Captain
Ahab,"_said
Tashtego,_"that
white_whale
must_be
the_same
that_some
call_Moby
Dick."_
"Moby_Dick?"
shouted_Ahab.
_"Do
ye_know
the_white
whale_then,
Tash?"_
"Does_he
fan-tail_a
little_curious,
sir,_before
he_goes
down?"_said
the_Gay-Header
deliberately._
"And_has
he_a
curious_spout,
too,"_said
Daggoo,_"very
bushy,_even
for_a
parmacetty,_and
mighty_quick,
Captain_Ahab?"
_"And
he_have
one,_two,
three--oh!_good
many_iron
in_him
hide,_too,
Captain,"_cried
Queequeg_disjointedly,
"all_twiske-tee
be-twisk,_like
him--him--"_faltering
hard_for
a_word,
and_screwing
his_hand
round_and
round_as
though_uncorking
a_bottle--"like
him--him--"_
"Corkscrew!"_cried
Ahab,_"aye,
Queequeg,_the
harpoons_lie
all_twisted
and_wrenched
in_him;
aye,_Daggoo,
his_spout
is_a
big_one,
like_a
whole_shock
of_wheat,
and_white
as_a
pile_of
our_Nantucket
wool_after
the_great
annual_sheep-shearing;
aye,_Tashtego,
and_he
fan-tails_like
a_split
jib_in
a_squall.
_Death
and_devils!
men,_it
is_Moby
Dick_ye
have_seen--Moby
Dick--Moby_Dick!"
_"Captain
Ahab,"_said
Starbuck,_who,
with_Stubb
and_Flask,
had_thus
far_been
eyeing_his
superior_with
increasing_surprise,
but_at
last_seemed
struck_with
a_thought
which_somewhat
explained_all
the_wonder.
"Captain_Ahab,
I_have
heard_of
Moby_Dick--but
it_was
not_Moby
Dick_that
took_off
thy_leg?"
_"Who
told_thee
that?"_cried
Ahab;_then
pausing,_"Aye,
Starbuck;_aye,
my_hearties
all_round;
it_was
Moby_Dick
that_dismasted
me;_Moby
Dick_that
brought_me
to_this
dead_stump
I_stand
on_now.
_Aye,
aye,"_he
shouted_with
a_terrific,
loud,_animal
sob,_like
that_of
a_heart-stricken
moose;_"Aye,
aye!_it
was_that
accursed_white
whale_that
razeed_me;
made_a
poor_pegging
lubber_of
me_for
ever_and
a_day!"
Then_tossing
both_arms,
with_measureless
imprecations_he
shouted_out:
"Aye,_aye!
and_I'll
chase_him
round_Good
Hope,_and
round_the
Horn,_and
round_the
Norway_Maelstrom,
and_round
perdition's_flames
before_I
give_him
up._
And_this
is_what
ye_have
shipped_for,
men!_to
chase_that
white_whale
on_both
sides_of
land,_and
over_all
sides_of
earth,_till
he_spouts
black_blood
and_rolls
fin_out.
_What
say_ye,
men,_will
ye_splice
hands_on
it,_now?
_I
think_ye
do_look
brave."_
"Aye,_aye!"
shouted_the
harpooneers_and
seamen,_running
closer_to
the_excited
old_man:
"A_sharp
eye_for
the_white
whale;_a
sharp_lance
for_Moby
Dick!"_
"God_bless
ye,"_he
seemed_to
half_sob
and_half
shout._
"God_bless
ye,_men.
_Steward!
go_draw
the_great
measure_of
grog._
But_what's
this_long
face_about,
Mr._Starbuck;
wilt_thou
not_chase
the_white
whale?_art
not_game
for_Moby
Dick?"_
"I_am
game_for
his_crooked
jaw,_and
for_the
jaws_of
Death_too,
Captain_Ahab,
if_it
fairly_comes
in_the
way_of
the_business
we_follow;
but_I
came_here
to_hunt
whales,_not
my_commander's
vengeance._How
many_barrels
will_thy
vengeance_yield
thee_even
if_thou
gettest_it,
Captain_Ahab?
it_will
not_fetch
thee_much
in_our
Nantucket_market."
_"Nantucket
market!_
Hoot!_
But_come
closer,_Starbuck;
thou_requirest
a_little
lower_layer.
_If
money's_to
be_the
measurer,_man,
and_the
accountants_have
computed_their
great_counting-house
the_globe,
by_girdling
it_with
guineas,_one
to_every
three_parts
of_an
inch;_then,
let_me
tell_thee,
that_my
vengeance_will
fetch_a
great_premium
HERE!"_
"He_smites
his_chest,"
whispered_Stubb,
"what's_that
for?_methinks
it_rings
most_vast,
but_hollow."
_"Vengeance
on_a
dumb_brute!"
cried_Starbuck,
"that_simply
smote_thee
from_blindest
instinct!_
Madness!_
To_be
enraged_with
a_dumb
thing,_Captain
Ahab,_seems
blasphemous."_
"Hark_ye
yet_again--the
little_lower
layer._
All_visible
objects,_man,
are_but
as_pasteboard
masks._
But_in
each_event--in
the_living
act,_the
undoubted_deed--there,
some_unknown
but_still
reasoning_thing
puts_forth
the_mouldings
of_its
features_from
behind_the
unreasoning_mask.
_If
man_will
strike,_strike
through_the
mask!_
How_can
the_prisoner
reach_outside
except_by
thrusting_through
the_wall?
To_me,
the_white
whale_is
that_wall,
shoved_near
to_me.
_Sometimes
I_think
there's_naught
beyond._
But_'tis
enough._
He_tasks
me;_he
heaps_me;
I_see
in_him
outrageous_strength,
with_an
inscrutable_malice
sinewing_it.
_That
inscrutable_thing
is_chiefly
what_I
hate;_and
be_the
white_whale
agent,_or
be_the
white_whale
principal,_I
will_wreak
that_hate
upon_him.
_Talk
not_to
me_of
blasphemy,_man;
I'd_strike
the_sun
if_it
insulted_me.
_For
could_the
sun_do
that,_then
could_I
do_the
other;_since
there_is
ever_a
sort_of
fair_play
herein,_jealousy
presiding_over
all_creations.
_But
not_my
master,_man,
is_even
that_fair
play._
Who's_over
me?_
Truth_hath
no_confines.
_Take
off_thine
eye!_more
intolerable_than
fiends'_glarings
is_a
doltish_stare!
_So,
so;_thou
reddenest_and
palest;_my
heat_has
melted_thee
to_anger-glow.
But_look
ye,_Starbuck,
what_is
said_in
heat,_that
thing_unsays
itself._
There_are
men_from
whom_warm
words_are
small_indignity.
_I
meant_not
to_incense
thee._
Let_it
go._
Look!_see
yonder_Turkish
cheeks_of
spotted_tawn--living,
breathing_pictures
painted_by
the_sun.
_The
Pagan_leopards--the
unrecking_and
unworshipping_things,
that_live;
and_seek,
and_give
no_reasons
for_the
torrid_life
they_feel!
_The
crew,_man,
the_crew!
_Are
they_not
one_and
all_with
Ahab,_in
this_matter
of_the
whale?_
See_Stubb!
he_laughs!
_See
yonder_Chilian!
he_snorts
to_think
of_it.
_Stand
up_amid
the_general
hurricane,_thy
one_tost
sapling_cannot,
Starbuck!_
And_what
is_it?
Reckon_it.
_'Tis
but_to
help_strike
a_fin;
no_wondrous
feat_for
Starbuck._
What_is
it_more?
_From
this_one
poor_hunt,
then,_the
best_lance
out_of
all_Nantucket,
surely_he
will_not
hang_back,
when_every
foremast-hand_has
clutched_a
whetstone?_
Ah!_constrainings
seize_thee;
I_see!
the_billow
lifts_thee!
_Speak,
but_speak!--Aye,
aye!_thy
silence,_then,
THAT_voices
thee._
(ASIDE)_Something
shot_from
my_dilated
nostrils,_he
has_inhaled
it_in
his_lungs.
_Starbuck
now_is
mine;_cannot
oppose_me
now,_without
rebellion."_
"God_keep
me!--keep_us
all!"_murmured
Starbuck,_lowly.
_But
in_his
joy_at
the_enchanted,
tacit_acquiescence
of_the
mate,_Ahab
did_not
hear_his
foreboding_invocation;
nor_yet
the_low
laugh_from
the_hold;
nor_yet
the_presaging
vibrations_of
the_winds
in_the
cordage;_nor
yet_the
hollow_flap
of_the
sails_against
the_masts,
as_for
a_moment
their_hearts
sank_in.
_For
again_Starbuck's
downcast_eyes
lighted_up
with_the
stubbornness_of
life;_the
subterranean_laugh
died_away;
the_winds
blew_on;
the_sails
filled_out;
the_ship
heaved_and
rolled_as
before._
Ah,_ye
admonitions_and
warnings!_why
stay_ye
not_when
ye_come?
_But
rather_are
ye_predictions
than_warnings,
ye_shadows!
_Yet
not_so
much_predictions
from_without,
as_verifications
of_the
foregoing_things
within._
For_with
little_external
to_constrain
us,_the
innermost_necessities
in_our
being,_these
still_drive
us_on.
_"The
measure!_the
measure!"_cried
Ahab._
Receiving_the
brimming_pewter,
and_turning
to_the
harpooneers,_he
ordered_them
to_produce
their_weapons.
_Then
ranging_them
before_him
near_the
capstan,_with
their_harpoons
in_their
hands,_while
his_three
mates_stood
at_his
side_with
their_lances,
and_the
rest_of
the_ship's
company_formed
a_circle
round_the
group;_he
stood_for
an_instant
searchingly_eyeing
every_man
of_his
crew._
But_those
wild_eyes
met_his,
as_the
bloodshot_eyes
of_the
prairie_wolves
meet_the
eye_of
their_leader,
ere_he
rushes_on
at_their
head_in
the_trail
of_the
bison;_but,
alas!_only
to_fall
into_the
hidden_snare
of_the
Indian._
"Drink_and
pass!"_he
cried,_handing
the_heavy
charged_flagon
to_the
nearest_seaman.
_"The
crew_alone
now_drink.
_Round
with_it,
round!_Short
draughts--long_swallows,
men;_'tis
hot_as
Satan's_hoof.
_So,
so;_it
goes_round
excellently._
It_spiralizes
in_ye;
forks_out
at_the
serpent-snapping_eye.
_Well
done;_almost
drained._
That_way
it_went,
this_way
it_comes.
_Hand
it_me--here's
a_hollow!
_Men,
ye_seem
the_years;
so_brimming
life_is
gulped_and
gone._
Steward,_refill!
_"Attend
now,_my
braves._
I_have
mustered_ye
all_round
this_capstan;
and_ye
mates,_flank
me_with
your_lances;
and_ye
harpooneers,_stand
there_with
your_irons;
and_ye,
stout_mariners,
ring_me
in,_that
I_may
in_some
sort_revive
a_noble
custom_of
my_fisherman
fathers_before
me._
O_men,
you_will
yet_see
that--Ha!_boy,
come_back?
bad_pennies
come_not
sooner._
Hand_it
me._
Why,_now,
this_pewter
had_run
brimming_again,
were't_not
thou_St.
Vitus'_imp--away,
thou_ague!
_"Advance,
ye_mates!
_Cross
your_lances
full_before
me._
Well_done!
Let_me
touch_the
axis."_
So_saying,
with_extended
arm,_he
grasped_the
three_level,
radiating_lances
at_their
crossed_centre;
while_so
doing,_suddenly
and_nervously
twitched_them;
meanwhile,_glancing
intently_from
Starbuck_to
Stubb;_from
Stubb_to
Flask._
It_seemed
as_though,
by_some
nameless,_interior
volition,_he
would_fain
have_shocked
into_them
the_same
fiery_emotion
accumulated_within
the_Leyden
jar_of
his_own
magnetic_life.
_The
three_mates
quailed_before
his_strong,
sustained,_and
mystic_aspect.
_Stubb
and_Flask
looked_sideways
from_him;
the_honest
eye_of
Starbuck_fell
downright._
"In_vain!"
cried_Ahab;
"but,_maybe,
'tis_well.
_For
did_ye
three_but
once_take
the_full-forced
shock,_then
mine_own
electric_thing,
THAT_had
perhaps_expired
from_out
me._
Perchance,_too,
it_would
have_dropped
ye_dead.
_Perchance
ye_need
it_not.
_Down
lances!_
And_now,
ye_mates,
I_do
appoint_ye
three_cupbearers
to_my
three_pagan
kinsmen_there--yon
three_most
honourable_gentlemen
and_noblemen,
my_valiant
harpooneers._
Disdain_the
task?_
What,_when
the_great
Pope_washes
the_feet
of_beggars,
using_his
tiara_for
ewer?_
Oh,_my
sweet_cardinals!
your_own
condescension,_THAT
shall_bend
ye_to
it._
I_do
not_order
ye;_ye
will_it.
_Cut
your_seizings
and_draw
the_poles,
ye_harpooneers!"
_Silently
obeying_the
order,_the
three_harpooneers
now_stood
with_the
detached_iron
part_of
their_harpoons,
some_three
feet_long,
held,_barbs
up,_before
him._
"Stab_me
not_with
that_keen
steel!_
Cant_them;
cant_them
over!_know
ye_not
the_goblet
end?_
Turn_up
the_socket!
_So,
so;_now,
ye_cup-bearers,
advance._
The_irons!
take_them;
hold_them
while_I
fill!"_Forthwith,
slowly_going
from_one
officer_to
the_other,
he_brimmed
the_harpoon
sockets_with
the_fiery
waters_from
the_pewter.
_"Now,
three_to
three,_ye
stand._
Commend_the
murderous_chalices!
Bestow_them,
ye_who
are_now
made_parties
to_this
indissoluble_league.
Ha!_
Starbuck!_but
the_deed
is_done!
_Yon
ratifying_sun
now_waits
to_sit
upon_it.
_Drink,
ye_harpooneers!
drink_and
swear,_ye
men_that
man_the
deathful_whaleboat's
bow--Death_to
Moby_Dick!
_God
hunt_us
all,_if
we_do
not_hunt
Moby_Dick
to_his
death!"_
The_long,
barbed_steel
goblets_were
lifted;_and
to_cries
and_maledictions
against_the
white_whale,
the_spirits
were_simultaneously
quaffed_down
with_a
hiss._Starbuck
paled,_and
turned,_and
shivered._
Once_more,
and_finally,
the_replenished
pewter_went
the_rounds
among_the
frantic_crew;
when,_waving
his_free
hand_to
them,_they
all_dispersed;
and_Ahab
retired_within
his_cabin.
_
_CHAPTER

Sunset._
_THE
CABIN;_BY
THE_STERN
WINDOWS;_AHAB
SITTING_ALONE,
AND_GAZING
OUT._
_I
leave_a
white_and
turbid_wake;
pale_waters,
paler_cheeks,
where'er_I
sail._
The_envious
billows_sidelong
swell_to
whelm_my
track;_let
them;_but
first_I
pass._
Yonder,_by
ever-brimming_goblet's
rim,_the
warm_waves
blush_like
wine._
The_gold
brow_plumbs
the_blue.
_The
diver_sun--slow
dived_from
noon--goes_down;
my_soul
mounts_up!
she_wearies
with_her
endless_hill.
_Is,
then,_the
crown_too
heavy_that
I_wear?
this_Iron
Crown_of
Lombardy._
Yet_is
it_bright
with_many
a_gem;
I_the
wearer,_see
not_its
far_flashings;
but_darkly
feel_that
I_wear
that,_that
dazzlingly_confounds.
_'Tis
iron--that_I
know--not_gold.
_'Tis
split,_too--that
I_feel;
the_jagged
edge_galls
me_so,
my_brain
seems_to
beat_against
the_solid
metal;_aye,
steel_skull,
mine;_the
sort_that
needs_no

the_most
brain-battering_fight!
_Dry
heat_upon
my_brow?
_Oh!
time_was,
when_as
the_sunrise
nobly_spurred
me,_so
the_sunset
soothed._
No_more.
_This
lovely_light,
it_lights
not_me;
all_loveliness
is_anguish
to_me,
since_I
can_ne'er
enjoy._
Gifted_with
the_high
perception,_I
lack_the
low,_enjoying
power;_damned,
most_subtly
and_most
malignantly!_damned
in_the
midst_of
Paradise!_
Good_night--good
night!_(WAVING
HIS_HAND,
HE_MOVES
FROM_THE
WINDOW.)_
'Twas_not
so_hard
a_task.
_I
thought_to
find_one
stubborn,_at
the_least;
but_my
one_cogged
circle_fits
into_all
their_various
wheels,_and
they_revolve.
_Or,
if_you
will,_like
so_many
ant-hills_of
powder,_they
all_stand
before_me;
and_I
their_match.
_Oh,
hard!_that
to_fire
others,_the
match_itself
must_needs
be_wasting!
_What
I've_dared,
I've_willed;
and_what
I've_willed,
I'll_do!
_They
think_me
mad--Starbuck_does;
but_I'm
demoniac,_I
am_madness
maddened!_
That_wild
madness_that's
only_calm
to_comprehend
itself!_
The_prophecy
was_that
I_should
be_dismembered;
and--Aye!_
I_lost
this_leg.
_I
now_prophesy
that_I
will_dismember
my_dismemberer.
_Now,
then,_be
the_prophet

_That's

_I

Dusk._
_BY
THE_MAINMAST;
STARBUCK_LEANING
AGAINST_IT.
_
My_soul
is_more
than_matched;
she's_overmanned;
and_by
a_madman!
Insufferable_sting,
that_sanity
should_ground
arms_on
such_a
field!_But
he_drilled
deep_down,
and_blasted
all_my
reason_out
of_me!
_I
think_I
see_his
impious_end;
but_feel
that_I
must_help
him_to
it._Will
I,_nill
I,_the
ineffable_thing
has_tied
me_to
him;_tows
me_with
a_cable
I_have
no_knife
to_cut.
_Horrible
old_man!
_Who's
over_him,
he_cries;--aye,
he_would
be_a
democrat_to
all_above;
look,_how
he_lords
it_over
all_below!
_Oh!
_I
plainly_see
my_miserable
office,--to_obey,
rebelling;_and
worse_yet,
to_hate
with_touch
of_pity!
_For
in_his
eyes_I
read_some
lurid_woe
would_shrivel
me_up,
had_I
it._
Yet_is
there_hope.
_Time
and_tide
flow_wide.
_The
hated_whale
has_the
round_watery
world_to
swim_in,
as_the

_
_CHAPTER
41_
Moby_Dick.
_
I,_Ishmael,
was_one
of_that
crew;_my
shouts_had
gone_up
with_the
rest;_my
oath_had
been_welded
with_theirs;
and_stronger
I_shouted,
and_more
did_I
hammer_and
clinch_my
oath,_because
of_the
dread_in
my_soul.
_A
wild,_mystical,
sympathetical_feeling
was_in
me;_Ahab's
quenchless_feud
seemed_mine.
_With
greedy_ears
I_learned
the_history
of_that
murderous_monster
against_whom
I_and
all_the
others_had
taken_our
oaths_of
violence_and
revenge._
For_some
time_past,
though_at
intervals_only,
the_unaccompanied,
secluded_White
Whale_had
haunted_those
uncivilized_seas
mostly_frequented
by_the
Sperm_Whale
fishermen._
But_not
all_of
them_knew
of_his
existence;_only
a_few
of_them,
comparatively,_had
knowingly_seen
him;_while
the_number
who_as
yet_had
actually_and
knowingly_given
battle_to
him,_was
small_indeed.
_For,
owing_to
the_large
number_of
whale-cruisers;_the
disorderly_way
they_were
sprinkled_over
the_entire
watery_circumference,
many_of
them_adventurously
pushing_their
quest_along
solitary_latitudes,
so_as
seldom_or
never_for
a_whole
twelvemonth_or
more_on
a_stretch,
to_encounter
a_single
news-telling_sail
of_any
sort;_the
inordinate_length
of_each
separate_voyage;
the_irregularity
of_the
times_of
sailing_from
home;_all
these,_with
other_circumstances,
direct_and
indirect,_long
obstructed_the
spread_through
the_whole
world-wide_whaling-fleet
of_the
special_individualizing
tidings_concerning
Moby_Dick.
_It
was_hardly
to_be
doubted,_that
several_vessels
reported_to
have_encountered,
at_such
or_such
a_time,
or_on
such_or
such_a
meridian,_a
Sperm_Whale
of_uncommon
magnitude_and
malignity,_which
whale,_after
doing_great
mischief_to
his_assailants,
had_completely
escaped_them;
to_some
minds_it
was_not
an_unfair
presumption,_I
say,_that
the_whale
in_question
must_have
been_no
other_than
Moby_Dick.
_Yet
as_of
late_the
Sperm_Whale
fishery_had
been_marked
by_various
and_not
unfrequent_instances
of_great
ferocity,_cunning,
and_malice
in_the
monster_attacked;
therefore_it
was,_that
those_who
by_accident
ignorantly_gave
battle_to
Moby_Dick;
such_hunters,
perhaps,_for
the_most
part,_were
content_to
ascribe_the
peculiar_terror
he_bred,
more,_as
it_were,
to_the
perils_of
the_Sperm
Whale_fishery
at_large,
than_to
the_individual
cause._
In_that
way,_mostly,
the_disastrous
encounter_between
Ahab_and
the_whale
had_hitherto
been_popularly
regarded._
And_as
for_those
who,_previously
hearing_of
the_White
Whale,_by
chance_caught
sight_of
him;_in
the_beginning
of_the
thing_they
had_every
one_of
them,_almost,
as_boldly
and_fearlessly
lowered_for
him,_as
for_any
other_whale
of_that
species._
But_at
length,_such
calamities_did
ensue_in
these_assaults--not
restricted_to
sprained_wrists
and_ankles,
broken_limbs,
or_devouring
amputations--but_fatal
to_the
last_degree
of_fatality;
those_repeated
disastrous_repulses,
all_accumulating
and_piling
their_terrors
upon_Moby
Dick;_those
things_had
gone_far
to_shake
the_fortitude
of_many
brave_hunters,
to_whom
the_story
of_the
White_Whale
had_eventually
come._
Nor_did
wild_rumors
of_all
sorts_fail
to_exaggerate,
and_still
the_more
horrify_the
true_histories
of_these
deadly_encounters.
_For
not_only
do_fabulous
rumors_naturally
grow_out
of_the
very_body
of_all
surprising_terrible
events,--as_the
smitten_tree
gives_birth
to_its
fungi;_but,
in_maritime
life,_far
more_than
in_that
of_terra
firma,_wild
rumors_abound,
wherever_there
is_any
adequate_reality
for_them
to_cling
to._
And_as
the_sea
surpasses_the
land_in
this_matter,
so_the
whale_fishery
surpasses_every
other_sort
of_maritime
life,_in
the_wonderfulness
and_fearfulness
of_the
rumors_which
sometimes_circulate
there._
For_not
only_are
whalemen_as
a_body
unexempt_from
that_ignorance
and_superstitiousness
hereditary_to
all_sailors;
but_of
all_sailors,
they_are
by_all
odds_the
most_directly
brought_into
contact_with
whatever_is
appallingly_astonishing
in_the
sea;_face
to_face
they_not
only_eye
its_greatest
marvels,_but,
hand_to
jaw,_give
battle_to
them._
Alone,_in
such_remotest
waters,_that
though_you
sailed_a
thousand_miles,
and_passed
a_thousand
shores,_you
would_not
come_to
any_chiseled
hearth-stone,_or
aught_hospitable
beneath_that
part_of
the_sun;
in_such
latitudes_and
longitudes,_pursuing
too_such
a_calling
as_he
does,_the
whaleman_is
wrapped_by
influences_all
tending_to
make_his
fancy_pregnant
with_many
a_mighty
birth._
No_wonder,
then,_that
ever_gathering
volume_from
the_mere
transit_over
the_widest
watery_spaces,
the_outblown
rumors_of
the_White
Whale_did
in_the
end_incorporate
with_themselves
all_manner
of_morbid
hints,_and
half-formed_foetal
suggestions_of
supernatural_agencies,
which_eventually
invested_Moby
Dick_with
new_terrors
unborrowed_from
anything_that
visibly_appears.
_So
that_in
many_cases
such_a
panic_did
he_finally
strike,_that
few_who
by_those
rumors,_at
least,_had
heard_of
the_White
Whale,_few
of_those
hunters_were
willing_to
encounter_the
perils_of
his_jaw.
_But
there_were
still_other
and_more
vital_practical
influences_at
work._
Not_even
at_the
present_day
has_the
original_prestige
of_the
Sperm_Whale,
as_fearfully
distinguished_from
all_other
species_of
the_leviathan,
died_out
of_the
minds_of
the_whalemen
as_a
body._
There_are
those_this
day_among
them,_who,
though_intelligent
and_courageous
enough_in
offering_battle
to_the
Greenland_or
Right_whale,
would_perhaps--either
from_professional
inexperience,_or
incompetency,_or
timidity,_decline
a_contest
with_the
Sperm_Whale;
at_any
rate,_there
are_plenty
of_whalemen,
especially_among
those_whaling
nations_not
sailing_under
the_American
flag,_who
have_never
hostilely_encountered
the_Sperm
Whale,_but
whose_sole
knowledge_of
the_leviathan
is_restricted
to_the
ignoble_monster
primitively_pursued
in_the
North;_seated
on_their
hatches,_these
men_will
hearken_with
a_childish
fireside_interest
and_awe,
to_the
wild,_strange
tales_of
Southern_whaling.
_Nor
is_the
pre-eminent_tremendousness
of_the
great_Sperm
Whale_anywhere
more_feelingly
comprehended,_than
on_board
of_those
prows_which
stem_him.
_And
as_if
the_now
tested_reality
of_his
might_had
in_former
legendary_times
thrown_its
shadow_before
it;_we
find_some
book_naturalists--Olassen
and_Povelson--declaring
the_Sperm
Whale_not
only_to
be_a
consternation_to
every_other
creature_in
the_sea,
but_also
to_be
so_incredibly
ferocious_as
continually_to
be_athirst
for_human
blood._
Nor_even
down_to
so_late
a_time
as_Cuvier's,
were_these
or_almost
similar_impressions
effaced._
For_in
his_Natural
History,_the
Baron_himself
affirms_that
at_sight
of_the
Sperm_Whale,
all_fish
(sharks_included)
are_"struck
with_the
most_lively
terrors,"_and
"often_in
the_precipitancy
of_their
flight_dash
themselves_against
the_rocks
with_such
violence_as
to_cause
instantaneous_death."
_And
however_the
general_experiences
in_the
fishery_may
amend_such
reports_as
these;_yet
in_their
full_terribleness,
even_to
the_bloodthirsty
item_of
Povelson,_the
superstitious_belief
in_them
is,_in
some_vicissitudes
of_their
vocation,_revived
in_the
minds_of
the_hunters.
_So
that_overawed
by_the
rumors_and
portents_concerning
him,_not
a_few
of_the
fishermen_recalled,
in_reference
to_Moby
Dick,_the
earlier_days
of_the
Sperm_Whale
fishery,_when
it_was
oftentimes_hard
to_induce
long_practised
Right_whalemen
to_embark
in_the
perils_of
this_new
and_daring
warfare;_such
men_protesting
that_although
other_leviathans
might_be
hopefully_pursued,
yet_to
chase_and
point_lance
at_such
an_apparition
as_the
Sperm_Whale
was_not
for_mortal
man._That
to_attempt
it,_would
be_inevitably
to_be
torn_into
a_quick
eternity._
On_this
head,_there
are_some
remarkable_documents
that_may
be_consulted.
_Nevertheless,
some_there
were,_who
even_in
the_face
of_these
things_were
ready_to
give_chase
to_Moby
Dick;_and
a_still
greater_number
who,_chancing
only_to
hear_of
him_distantly
and_vaguely,
without_the
specific_details
of_any
certain_calamity,
and_without
superstitious_accompaniments,
were_sufficiently
hardy_not
to_flee
from_the
battle_if
offered._
One_of
the_wild
suggestions_referred
to,_as
at_last
coming_to
be_linked
with_the
White_Whale
in_the
minds_of
the_superstitiously
inclined,_was
the_unearthly
conceit_that
Moby_Dick
was_ubiquitous;
that_he
had_actually
been_encountered
in_opposite
latitudes_at
one_and
the_same
instant_of
time._
Nor,_credulous
as_such
minds_must
have_been,
was_this
conceit_altogether
without_some
faint_show
of_superstitious
probability._
For_as
the_secrets
of_the
currents_in
the_seas
have_never
yet_been
divulged,_even
to_the
most_erudite
research;_so
the_hidden
ways_of
the_Sperm
Whale_when
beneath_the
surface_remain,
in_great
part,_unaccountable
to_his
pursuers;_and
from_time
to_time
have_originated
the_most
curious_and
contradictory_speculations
regarding_them,
especially_concerning
the_mystic
modes_whereby,
after_sounding
to_a
great_depth,
he_transports
himself_with
such_vast
swiftness_to
the_most
widely_distant
points._
It_is
a_thing
well_known
to_both
American_and
English_whale-ships,
and_as
well_a
thing_placed
upon_authoritative
record_years
ago_by
Scoresby,_that
some_whales
have_been
captured_far
north_in
the_Pacific,
in_whose
bodies_have
been_found
the_barbs
of_harpoons
darted_in
the_Greenland
seas._
Nor_is
it_to
be_gainsaid,
that_in
some_of
these_instances
it_has
been_declared
that_the
interval_of
time_between
the_two
assaults_could
not_have
exceeded_very
many_days.
Hence,_by
inference,_it
has_been
believed_by
some_whalemen,
that_the
Nor'_West
Passage,_so
long_a
problem_to
man,_was
never_a
problem_to
the_whale.
_So
that_here,
in_the
real_living
experience_of
living_men,
the_prodigies
related_in
old_times
of_the
inland_Strello
mountain_in
Portugal_(near
whose_top
there_was
said_to
be_a
lake_in
which_the
wrecks_of
ships_floated
up_to
the_surface);
and_that
still_more
wonderful_story
of_the
Arethusa_fountain
near_Syracuse
(whose_waters
were_believed
to_have
come_from
the_Holy
Land_by
an_underground
passage);_these
fabulous_narrations
are_almost
fully_equalled
by_the
realities_of
the_whalemen.
_Forced
into_familiarity,
then,_with
such_prodigies
as_these;
and_knowing
that_after
repeated,_intrepid
assaults,_the
White_Whale
had_escaped
alive;_it
cannot_be
much_matter
of_surprise
that_some
whalemen_should
go_still
further_in
their_superstitions;
declaring_Moby
Dick_not
only_ubiquitous,
but_immortal
(for_immortality
is_but
ubiquity_in
time);_that
though_groves
of_spears
should_be
planted_in
his_flanks,
he_would
still_swim
away_unharmed;
or_if
indeed_he
should_ever
be_made
to_spout
thick_blood,
such_a
sight_would
be_but
a_ghastly
deception;_for
again_in
unensanguined_billows
hundreds_of
leagues_away,
his_unsullied
jet_would
once_more
be_seen.
_But
even_stripped
of_these
supernatural_surmisings,
there_was
enough_in
the_earthly
make_and
incontestable_character
of_the
monster_to
strike_the
imagination_with
unwonted_power.
_For,
it_was
not_so
much_his
uncommon_bulk
that_so
much_distinguished
him_from
other_sperm
whales,_but,
as_was
elsewhere_thrown
out--a_peculiar
snow-white_wrinkled
forehead,_and
a_high,
pyramidical_white
hump._
These_were
his_prominent
features;_the
tokens_whereby,
even_in
the_limitless,
uncharted_seas,
he_revealed
his_identity,
at_a
long_distance,
to_those
who_knew
him._
The_rest
of_his
body_was
so_streaked,
and_spotted,
and_marbled
with_the
same_shrouded
hue,_that,
in_the
end,_he
had_gained
his_distinctive
appellation_of
the_White
Whale;_a
name,_indeed,
literally_justified
by_his
vivid_aspect,
when_seen
gliding_at
high_noon
through_a
dark_blue
sea,_leaving
a_milky-way
wake_of
creamy_foam,
all_spangled
with_golden
gleamings._
Nor_was
it_his
unwonted_magnitude,
nor_his
remarkable_hue,
nor_yet
his_deformed
lower_jaw,
that_so
much_invested
the_whale
with_natural
terror,_as
that_unexampled,
intelligent_malignity
which,_according
to_specific
accounts,_he
had_over
and_over
again_evinced
in_his
assaults._
More_than
all,_his
treacherous_retreats
struck_more
of_dismay
than_perhaps
aught_else.
_For,
when_swimming
before_his
exulting_pursuers,
with_every
apparent_symptom
of_alarm,
he_had
several_times
been_known
to_turn
round_suddenly,
and,_bearing
down_upon
them,_either
stave_their
boats_to
splinters,_or
drive_them
back_in
consternation_to
their_ship.
_Already
several_fatalities
had_attended
his_chase.
_But
though_similar
disasters,_however
little_bruited
ashore,_were
by_no
means_unusual
in_the
fishery;_yet,
in_most
instances,_such
seemed_the
White_Whale's
infernal_aforethought
of_ferocity,
that_every
dismembering_or
death_that
he_caused,
was_not
wholly_regarded
as_having
been_inflicted
by_an
unintelligent_agent.
_Judge,
then,_to
what_pitches
of_inflamed,
distracted_fury
the_minds
of_his
more_desperate
hunters_were
impelled,_when
amid_the
chips_of
chewed_boats,
and_the
sinking_limbs
of_torn
comrades,_they
swam_out
of_the
white_curds
of_the
whale's_direful
wrath_into
the_serene,
exasperating_sunlight,
that_smiled
on,_as
if_at
a_birth
or_a
bridal._
His_three
boats_stove
around_him,
and_oars
and_men
both_whirling
in_the
eddies;_one
captain,_seizing
the_line-knife
from_his
broken_prow,
had_dashed
at_the
whale,_as
an_Arkansas
duellist_at
his_foe,
blindly_seeking
with_a
six_inch
blade_to
reach_the
fathom-deep_life
of_the
whale._
That_captain
was_Ahab.
_And
then_it
was,_that
suddenly_sweeping
his_sickle-shaped
lower_jaw
beneath_him,
Moby_Dick
had_reaped
away_Ahab's
leg,_as
a_mower
a_blade
of_grass
in_the
field._
No_turbaned
Turk,_no
hired_Venetian
or_Malay,
could_have
smote_him
with_more
seeming_malice.
_Small
reason_was
there_to
doubt,_then,
that_ever
since_that
almost_fatal
encounter,_Ahab
had_cherished
a_wild
vindictiveness_against
the_whale,
all_the
more_fell
for_that
in_his
frantic_morbidness
he_at
last_came
to_identify
with_him,
not_only
all_his
bodily_woes,
but_all
his_intellectual
and_spiritual
exasperations._
The_White
Whale_swam
before_him
as_the
monomaniac_incarnation
of_all
those_malicious
agencies_which
some_deep
men_feel
eating_in
them,_till
they_are
left_living
on_with
half_a
heart_and
half_a
lung._
That_intangible
malignity_which
has_been
from_the
beginning;_to
whose_dominion
even_the
modern_Christians
ascribe_one-half
of_the
worlds;_which
the_ancient
Ophites_of
the_east
reverenced_in
their_statue
devil;--Ahab_did
not_fall
down_and
worship_it
like_them;
but_deliriously
transferring_its
idea_to
the_abhorred
white_whale,
he_pitted
himself,_all
mutilated,_against
it._
All_that
most_maddens
and_torments;
all_that
stirs_up
the_lees
of_things;
all_truth
with_malice
in_it;
all_that
cracks_the
sinews_and
cakes_the
brain;_all
the_subtle
demonisms_of
life_and
thought;_all
evil,_to
crazy_Ahab,
were_visibly
personified,_and
made_practically
assailable_in
Moby_Dick.
_He
piled_upon
the_whale's
white_hump
the_sum
of_all
the_general
rage_and
hate_felt
by_his
whole_race
from_Adam
down;_and
then,_as
if_his
chest_had
been_a
mortar,_he
burst_his
hot_heart's
shell_upon
it._
It_is
not_probable
that_this
monomania_in
him_took
its_instant
rise_at
the_precise
time_of
his_bodily
dismemberment._
Then,_in
darting_at
the_monster,
knife_in
hand,_he
had_but
given_loose
to_a
sudden,_passionate,
corporal_animosity;
and_when
he_received
the_stroke
that_tore
him,_he
probably_but
felt_the
agonizing_bodily
laceration,_but
nothing_more.
_Yet,
when_by
this_collision
forced_to
turn_towards
home,_and
for_long
months_of
days_and
weeks,_Ahab
and_anguish
lay_stretched
together_in
one_hammock,
rounding_in
mid_winter
that_dreary,
howling_Patagonian
Cape;_then
it_was,
that_his
torn_body
and_gashed
soul_bled
into_one
another;_and
so_interfusing,
made_him
mad._That
it_was
only_then,
on_the
homeward_voyage,
after_the
encounter,_that
the_final
monomania_seized
him,_seems
all_but
certain_from
the_fact
that,_at
intervals_during
the_passage,
he_was
a_raving
lunatic;_and,
though_unlimbed
of_a
leg,_yet
such_vital
strength_yet
lurked_in
his_Egyptian
chest,_and
was_moreover
intensified_by
his_delirium,
that_his
mates_were
forced_to
lace_him
fast,_even
there,_as
he_sailed,
raving_in
his_hammock.
_In
a_strait-jacket,
he_swung
to_the
mad_rockings
of_the
gales._
And,_when
running_into
more_sufferable
latitudes,_the
ship,_with
mild_stun'sails
spread,_floated
across_the
tranquil_tropics,
and,_to
all_appearances,
the_old
man's_delirium
seemed_left
behind_him
with_the
Cape_Horn
swells,_and
he_came
forth_from
his_dark
den_into
the_blessed
light_and
air;_even
then,_when
he_bore
that_firm,
collected_front,
however_pale,
and_issued
his_calm
orders_once
again;_and
his_mates
thanked_God
the_direful
madness_was
now_gone;
even_then,
Ahab,_in
his_hidden
self,_raved
on._
Human_madness
is_oftentimes
a_cunning
and_most
feline_thing.
_When
you_think
it_fled,
it_may
have_but
become_transfigured
into_some
still_subtler
form._
Ahab's_full
lunacy_subsided
not,_but
deepeningly_contracted;
like_the
unabated_Hudson,
when_that
noble_Northman
flows_narrowly,
but_unfathomably
through_the
Highland_gorge.
_But,
as_in
his_narrow-flowing
monomania,_not
one_jot
of_Ahab's
broad_madness
had_been
left_behind;
so_in
that_broad
madness,_not
one_jot
of_his
great_natural
intellect_had
perished._
That_before
living_agent,
now_became
the_living
instrument._
If_such
a_furious
trope_may
stand,_his
special_lunacy
stormed_his
general_sanity,
and_carried
it,_and
turned_all
its_concentred
cannon_upon
its_own
mad_mark;
so_that
far_from
having_lost
his_strength,
Ahab,_to
that_one
end,_did
now_possess
a_thousand
fold_more
potency_than
ever_he
had_sanely
brought_to
bear_upon
any_one
reasonable_object.
_This
is_much;
yet_Ahab's
larger,_darker,
deeper_part
remains_unhinted.
_But
vain_to
popularize_profundities,
and_all
truth_is
profound._
Winding_far
down_from
within_the
very_heart
of_this
spiked_Hotel
de_Cluny
where_we
here_stand--however
grand_and
wonderful,_now
quit_it;--and
take_your
way,_ye
nobler,_sadder
souls,_to
those_vast
Roman_halls
of_Thermes;
where_far
beneath_the
fantastic_towers
of_man's
upper_earth,
his_root
of_grandeur,
his_whole
awful_essence
sits_in
bearded_state;
an_antique
buried_beneath
antiquities,_and
throned_on
torsoes!_
So_with
a_broken
throne,_the
great_gods
mock_that
captive_king;
so_like
a_Caryatid,
he_patient
sits,_upholding
on_his
frozen_brow
the_piled
entablatures_of
ages._
Wind_ye
down_there,
ye_prouder,
sadder_souls!
question_that
proud,_sad
king!_
A_family
likeness!_aye,
he_did
beget_ye,
ye_young
exiled_royalties;
and_from
your_grim
sire_only
will_the
old_State-secret
come._
Now,_in
his_heart,
Ahab_had
some_glimpse
of_this,
namely:_all
my_means
are_sane,
my_motive
and_my
object_mad.
_Yet
without_power
to_kill,
or_change,
or_shun
the_fact;
he_likewise
knew_that
to_mankind
he_did
long_dissemble;
in_some
sort,_did
still._
But_that
thing_of
his_dissembling
was_only
subject_to
his_perceptibility,
not_to
his_will
determinate._
Nevertheless,_so
well_did
he_succeed
in_that
dissembling,_that
when_with
ivory_leg
he_stepped
ashore_at
last,_no
Nantucketer_thought
him_otherwise
than_but
naturally_grieved,
and_that
to_the
quick,_with
the_terrible
casualty_which
had_overtaken
him._
The_report
of_his
undeniable_delirium
at_sea
was_likewise
popularly_ascribed
to_a
kindred_cause.
_And
so_too,
all_the
added_moodiness
which_always
afterwards,_to
the_very
day_of
sailing_in
the_Pequod
on_the
present_voyage,
sat_brooding
on_his
brow._
Nor_is
it_so
very_unlikely,
that_far
from_distrusting
his_fitness
for_another
whaling_voyage,
o_
