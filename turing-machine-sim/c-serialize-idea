so we can do our serialization where we have our states

#define qEven
#define qOdd
#define INITIAL_STATE

Our alphabet table:

/* starting with inital/blank */
char alphabet[][] = {" ", "0", "1"}

For simplicity's sake, using a linked list

struct node {
    int value;
    node *next;
    node *prev;
}

a constructor taking in a file
